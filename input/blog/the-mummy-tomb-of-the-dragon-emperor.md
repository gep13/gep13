Again, let me state, this I am a huge fan of this franchise. Absolutely loved the first two films and even enjoyed the spin off The Scorpion King. However, the new [Mummy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443701/) film was a little bit of a let down.

Firstly, why oh why, was Rachel Weisz not in this movie?!?!? No offence to Maria Bello, but the film just wasn't the same without Rachel. The humour that normally goes along with the Mummy series also seemed to be a little lacking, with one too many references to the previous films.

On the plus side, visual effects were very good, and the fight scenes were also good! But overall, not great. I will probably still buy it on DVD though to complete the set, and I will also probably go and see the new Scorpion King movie that is coming out.
