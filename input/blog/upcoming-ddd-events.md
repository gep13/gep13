Hot on the heels of DDD9 in Reading, there are other DDD related events coming up in the near future.

- DDD Belfast – March 2011
- [DDD Scotland – May 7th 2011](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/)
- [DDD South West – June 11th 2011](http://www.dddsouthwest.com/)

Unfortunately, I haven’t heard too much about DDD Belfast, and there doesn’t seem to be any information on the DDD site. I am not going to be able to make this event anyway, but it would still be nice to see what I will be missing out on.

![](http://www.dddsouthwest.com/images/DDDScotland.png)DDD Scotland is at the stage that speakers have submitted there proposed sessions, and the community is now voting on them. For your chance to have a say about what sessions get included, make sure you vote for your favourites. I am really hoping to attend this event, as there are a number of proposed sessions, which if picked, I will be very interested in attending!!

![](http://www.dddsouthwest.com/images/DDDSouthWest3BadgeSmall.png)DDD South West is at the stage of looking for speakers. I would love to think that I am at the stage that I could think about submitting a session, but I know I am not. This is an area that I am hoping to move into, and with the help of Guy Smith-Ferrier’s video series [here](http://www.guysmithferrier.com/post/2011/02/Video-Series-How-To-Give-Great-Presentations.aspx), maybe I will think about submitting a session next year. Again, looking at some of the proposed sessions, I can see a lot of benefit in attending this event. It is obviously slightly further away, but would still be worth it.
