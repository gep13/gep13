While me and Lynn were at the Chinook Mall, I picked up a couple new books:
  
- [Stuart MacBride's Flesh House (fourth in the series)](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Flesh-House-Stuart-MacBride/dp/0007244541/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220410781&amp;sr=8-1)
- [Douglas Coupland's The Gum Thief](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gum-Thief-Douglas-Coupland/dp/0747591881/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220410890&amp;sr=1-1)

Just finished reading Flesh House, and again, I really enjoyed it! Gory as ever, but lot's of great dialogue, and the story flowed very well. I don't know if he is working on a new book, but if he is, I will definitely pick it up. If you are interested, you can find out more about the author [here](http://www.stuartmacbride.com/en/). Just read on that site that there is a new book out, but it isn't starring Logan McRae, or Aberdeen, but I will probably still get it.

Not sure when I will get round to reading The Gum Thief, but I will get round to it at some point.
