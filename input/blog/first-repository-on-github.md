# First repository created on GitHub

Today I created my first repository on GitHub:

![First Repository on GitHub](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/12/19/first-repository.png)

This [repository](https://github.com/gep13/VBForums-Enhanced-Tabbed-Web-Browser) is a proof of concept application that was originally created while helping out members of the online community over at [www.vbforums.com](www.vbforums.com). Building on the work that was originally carried out by jmcilhinney, this sample application adds a number of features to the Tabbed Web Browser. 

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
