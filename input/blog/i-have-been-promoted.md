Unfortunately, it is not at work, and it also doesn’t involved a pay rise, but…

I have been promoted from a “Moderator” to a “Super Moderator” over at [VBForums](http://www.vbforums.com/index.php). I have been a member of this forum since 2004, and primarily I post in the ASP.Net Forum, trying to help people where I can, but with the creation of a Silverlight, ASP.Net and WPF/WCF/WF Forums, I think I will be posting in these forums on a more regular basis.

I was given the title of Moderator back in December, and I guess I have been doing a good job, as I have been given the role of Super Moderator (admittedly, I had asked to become a Moderator in the above mentioned Forums, but I wasn’t expecting to be given the elevated title).

Still trying to work out exactly what additional capabilities this gives me on the site, but I am sure that I will figure it out as I go ![Smile](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/wlEmoticon-smile.png).
