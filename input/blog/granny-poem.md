# The Broken Chain

Today at my Granny's funeral, the following poem was read:

> We little knew that morning
That God was going to call your name.
In life  we loved you dearly.
In death we do the same.

> It broke our hearts to lose you
You did not go alone,
For part of us went with you
The day God called you home.

> You left us peaceful memories
Your love is still our guide,
And though we cannot see you
You are always by our side.

> Our family chain is broken,
And nothing seems the same,
But as God calls us one by one
The chain will link again.

It was found hand written on the back of a card, in my Granny's handwriting.  It is a lovely poem, and one that seemed exactly right for her service.

We are not sure exactly why my Granny had chosen to copy down the poem onto the card, but there must have been a reason.  A bit of research turned up the [following website](http://www.rontranmer.com/broken-chain-revised), which credits the poem (in a revised form) to Ron Trammer.  Thank you for your lovely words.
