# CakeBuild with Mattias Karlsson and Gary Ewan Park

I have been a long time listener of the [MS Dev Show](http://msdevshow.com/), but I am very proud to announce that a recording of myself and Mattias has just been published.  You can listen to us discussing Cake on the [April 2nd](http://msdevshow.com/2016/04/cakebuild-with-mattias-karlsson-and-gary-ewan-park/) show.  We were interviewed by the show's host Jason and Carl.

This was my first ever appearance on a Podcast, so I was a little bit nervous, but Jason and Carl very quickly put our nerves to rest, and the end result I was very happy with.
