If you aren’t already using [LearnVisualStudio.Net](http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/), then I would highly recommend that you give it a try.  I have had the lifetime membership for some years now, and I love it.

Now, onto the news...

The bottom line is, two major things are happening over at LearnVisualStudio:

1. Lifetime Membership’s are no longer going to exist
1. The ability to download the videos for watching later, isn’t going to exist

The second is a real shame, as it was always nice to be able to store the videos off for watching later, but I can understand the reasons for this change.

The first, you can avoid by going and getting yourself a lifetime membership right now :-)

The same policies seem to be getting applied to their sister website [TrainingSpot](http://www.trainingspot.com/Default.aspx), which is also a useful resource.
