# I am now a member of the Cake GitHub Organisation

Today, [Patrik](https://github.com/patriksvensson) and [Mattias](https://github.com/devlead) invited me to join them on the Cake Team on GitHub.

I was truly blown away when they decided to do this.  I have been watching the [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/) build system for a while now, and more recently I have started to use it in anger.  This has included creating Pull Requests to include tools within the GitTools Organisation as first class citizens in Cake.

Now as a full member of the team I will be helping with day to day running of the project, and helping shape the direction of the project.

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
