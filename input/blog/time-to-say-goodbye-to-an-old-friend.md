It is with a tinge of sadness, that today I had to say goodbye to an old friend. Over 6 years ago, I purchased my first car; a Silver Ford Focus Elle. I had been able to drive since passing my test when I was 17, but it wasn't until after finishing university that I purchased my first car. I loved this car, and I am happy to say that with the exception of having to replace a coil ignition unit, and general wear and tear, I have had no mechanical problems with my car (aside from the damage done to the car while parked outside my old flat, which included being scratched, wing mirrors kicked off, and being spray painted!!!).

But alas, all good things must come to an end, and today was the day that I said goodbye to "Elle":

Enter the new replacement. A 6 month old Ford Focus Zetec S:

I went back to the [Jim Reid Vehicle Sales](http://www.jimreidvehiclesales.co.uk/) which is where I bought the first car, and I got a cracking deal, both on the trade in, and with the added extras that were thrown in. If anyone in the North East is looking for a new car, definitely give Jim a shout, I am sure that he would be able to help you out.

I only picked up the car this lunch time, but I am already loving it. Great features include:

- Bluetooth hands free kit for mobile phone
- USB Port of connecting iPod
- Rear parking sensors
- Amazing body kit
- DAB Radio

I am sure that there will be loads more features that I come to find irreplaceable.
