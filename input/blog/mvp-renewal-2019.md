I am very happy to announce that I have been renewed as a Microsoft MVP.

<!--excerpt-->

Yesterday was sort of a weird day for me.  I had no expectations of being renewed as a Microsoft MVP, and I was very happy to receive the email from the MVP Global Administator to say that I was being renewed.

Watching Twitter throughout the day, and talking to some OSS colleagues who were also waiting to see if they were being renewed, the tension grew throughout the day.

At 13:39 I received the following email:

![MVP Renewal 2019](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/07/02/mvp_renewal_2019.png)

This will be my third year as a Microsoft MVP.  It was also this year that I was able to attend the MVP Summit in Redmond, and I am looking forward to attending this Summit again next year.

I just wanted to say congratulations to all the MVP's who were renewed this year, and to any MVP's who were no renewed **thank you** for your contributions to the Community, they are very much appreciated!

I tweeted about this here:
