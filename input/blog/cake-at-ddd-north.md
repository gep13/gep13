## Update

I was very happy with how this talk went on the day, but I was even happier once I got the speaker feedback.  These were the results/comments:

Speaker Knowledge: 9/9
Speaker Presentation: 8.41/9

- A lot to fit in within an hour but covered the basics well.
- Arrows back to front in build workflow? Pedantic me?
- Bring cake.
- Fantastic, thanks Gary.
- Great intro to cake. Thanks.
- Great talk, I will use it!
- Really nice demo. Good explanation of motivations (why/why not use it?). Debuggable build scripts is amazing.
- Well structured, clear. Thank you.

Thank you to everyone who attended, and I am very glad that you all liked it!
