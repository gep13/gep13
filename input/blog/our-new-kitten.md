Okay, this is about as far away from a .Net post as you can get, but I felt it had to be done.

We have just got our new kitten called Aiden, and I thought I would post a couple of photos:

Aiden is a Grey Colour Point Ragdoll kitten.  We got him from a breeder called Wendy, you can find her website here:

At the same time as we got Aiden, Lynn's sister also got a Kitten.  He is called Dexter, and he is Aiden's brother.  You can see photos of you below:
