# Herding Code 219: Cake with Gary Park and Mattias Karlsson

Following on the heels of a few podcasts appearances, I am happy to announce that myself and Mattias were interviewed on the [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/) talking about [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/).

You can find the show [here](http://herdingcode.com/herding-code-219-cake-with-gary-park-and-mattias-karlsson/).

Once again, I have to give a lot of credit to the guys behind these podcasts, they really do know what they are doing, and make it very easy to talk about the topic.  Thanks for having us on!
