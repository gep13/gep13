Me and Lynn took a few days to travel up to Banff to do some of the touristy things.

With the car hired, we travelled up to Banff, but we stopped on the way to visit Canmore and have some lunch. You can see some photos of that below:

Then it was back on the road to our final destination the Rimrock Hotel (took a slight detour with the GPS, but got there). The hotel was amazing, felt a fit underdressed with my shorts and t-shirts, but what the eh!! Had to get our room changed, since I had paid for an unobstructed view, and there was a tree right in front of our window. You can see some of the photos of the hotel below:

While we were waiting for our room to get sorted out, we went up on the Gondola ride to the top of Sulphur Mountain. The views from the top were amazing!!!Â  See for yourself:

The next day, we got back in the car and went in past Lake Louise:

on the way to our final destination which was a helicopter ride over the Rockie Mountains:

Lake Louise was really nice, the colour of the water was just magnificent, has to be seen to be believed. We didn't really have a lot of time at Lake Louise, since we had to get up the road for the chopper ride, you could have easily spent the whole day at Lake Louise. So it was back in the car, and onto the chopper!! We decided that we wanted to do the Nature Hike as well as the chopper ride, so after 20 minutes in the chopper (I got the front seat) the pilot landed, and we took a quick walk to a nearby waterfall. Lynn didn't really want to investigate, but I couldn't stop myself walking up to the edge and peering over.

The next day, we wandered round the shops in Banff and bought some presents for everyone:
