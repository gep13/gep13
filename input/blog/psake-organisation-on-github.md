# I am now a member of the psake project

I have been a long time user of the [psake](https://github.com/psake) build system, and today I was added as a member of the organisation in order to help with the maintenance effort.

[psake](https://github.com/psake), as a product, is pretty much complete.  It does what it does, and it does it well, however, every so often, there are things that need to be added, fixed.  With this in mind, I am happy to help out where/when I can.

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
