As some of you may remember, I recently [blogged](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=499) about the fact that I was missing some applications from my collection of Windows Phone 7 Apps. i.e. there were letters in my Windows Phone 7 Jump List that didn’t have any applications behind them.

With the help of some fellow Windows Phone 7 owners, I have now been able to complete the set (with the exception of the Globe icon in the bottom right hand corner. I am led to believe that this icon is for [handling foreign languages](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1204578), which I don’t have on my phone).

I will be updating the [complete list](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=305) of applications that I have installed in the next couple of days, but for now, the applications that completed the collection were:

- Jingle Balls
- Kayak
- Quick Reader
- VLC Play
- XDA Wallpaper
