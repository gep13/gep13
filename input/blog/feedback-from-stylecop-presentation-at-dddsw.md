# DDDSW Speaker Feedback Results are in

Last week the speakers at DDDSW received their feedback evaluations forms, myself included.

Now, I have to say that I was a bit nervous about getting these feedback forms as this was my first time doing a session at a conference the size DDDSW, However, I am happy to report that I am VERY happy with the results. Thank you to everyone who attended my session, and who provided the valuable feedback on my session. I will take all of your comments away, and try to improve this session going forward. It is clear from the feedback that the session was rushed towards the end, and this was due to the fact that I was over-running slightly. I will have to look at the content and move some things around in order to make the timings better.
