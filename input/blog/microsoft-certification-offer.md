Microsoft are now offering “Microsoft Certification Exam Packs” which provide you with up to 20% off the cost of the exams, plus a Second Shot Voucher thrown in for good measure. The packs come in 2, 3, 4, and 5 variants.

Full details can be found here:

The idea is that you sign up for the voucher code, use this to schedule your first exam, pay for all the exams initially, then use the same voucher again for the remaining exams.
