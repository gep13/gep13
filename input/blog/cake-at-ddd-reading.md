# A Piece of Cake
## C# powered cross platform build automation

In the same way that DDD Scotland made a welcome return this year, the same was true of [DDD Reading](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/).  A .Net Community event which is hosted in the Microsoft Offices in Thames Valley Park.  I have attended this event before, in fact, it was actually one of the first .Net Community events that I went to, and this year I was asked along to present my talk on Cake.

# The Code

## Update

Thank you to everyone who attended the event on the day.  I have just received the speaker feedback, and I have to say that I am very happy with the results/comments:

Speaker Knowledge: 8.62/9
Speaker Presentation: 7.85/9

- "Tenet" is not "Tennant"
- Brilliant!
- Clearly not passionate enough about cake :) Great talk, good intro
- Good product, talk needs a little more cheese/humour but good and informative
- Hungry now! :)
- Interesting - good demo nice intro to useful tools
- Would be good to have more demo time

I will be taking on board some of these comments for my upcoming talk at DDD North.
