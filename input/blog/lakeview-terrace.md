Went to see the new Samuel L Jackson film, [Lakeview Terrace](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0947802/), last night. Have to say that it was very good.

I thought Jackson did a very good job of portraying the psycho cop next door. Ending was maybe a little bit too “happy”, but all in all, worth a watch.
