# Copy Source As HTML 

When you are creating blog posts, or editing/adding web pages to a dynamic site, you quite often want to be able to include code, or XML, and have it colourized the same way it appears within Visual Studio. That is where CSAH (Copy Source As HTML) comes in:

A very nice Visual Studio Addin that creates an HTML div element of the code that you highlight in Visual Studio, all coloured and spaced as in the code window, which you can then paste wherever you want.
