For a long time, I have been an avid user of logmein, and I love it!!

[https://secure.logmein.com/](https://secure.logmein.com/)

I have all my friends and families machines connected to my free account which means if anyone is having any problems with their computer, and they are connected to the internet, then I can jump onto their machine, see what is going on, and take control if I need to, to fix the problem.

There are paid for versions of logmein available, that extend the feature set, such as File Share, Remote to Local Audio, etc, however, I have never felt the need for those versions.

There have been times though when I have been asked for help from people who are not connected to my logmein account, meaning that I can’t jump on and look at their machine. Although they try, some of the descriptions that I get from people (It’s not working...) makes it impossible to know what is going on, and it is just easier to be able to see their screen. There are ways to remotely connect computers to my logmein account, however, it isn’t a particularly simple process.

That is where [ShowMeWhatsWrong.com](http://showmewhatswrong.com/) steps in. Basically, it allows the user (me) to send a url to the person at the other end of the phone, and on clicking that link, they will be taken to a website that will start recording their screen, thus allowing them to show me what the problem is. Once completed, the video file is then sent to me in an email for me to take a look at.

Enjoy!!
