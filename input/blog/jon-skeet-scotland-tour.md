# Jon Skeet - Taking a quick break from Stack Overflow

It is with great pleasure that I can announce that I have been able to confirm Jon Skeet, [legendary contributor to Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet), and author of [C# in Depth](http://www.manning.com/skeet3/), to do User Group Presentations in Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh.

I have to say a big thank you to Jon for taking the time out of his busy schedule to come up to Scotland to do these talks, it really is very much appreciated!  Jon will be talking to two topics, "Semantics Matter" and "Abusing C#".  The Abusing C# talk will be repeated in both Aberdeen and Edinburgh, so if you can't make it to one, you have the option to attend the other.
