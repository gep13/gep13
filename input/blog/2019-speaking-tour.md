Hot on the heels of the speaking tour that I did [this time last year](https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2018-speaking-tour), I have decided that I am going to do it all over again!  I was approached by the organisers of the HaintonDotNet User Groups to see if I would be interested in doing my Cake talk at their User Groups in Newcastle and Middlesborough.  I said that I would be, and off the back of that I was able to secure another talk at Sheffield again, and then on the way home, a stop at Glasgow.

## Dates and venues

All the details of the talks are shown below.

### dotnetsheff - Sheffield

The first stop in the series has me visiting Sheffield on the 28th January 2019, to do a talk on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org).

## The Map

Roughly speaking, this will be around 900 miles of driving, and should take around 16 hours.

It's a good thing that I have just bought a couple new Audible books!
