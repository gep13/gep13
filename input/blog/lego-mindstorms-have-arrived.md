I am happy to say that I am now the proud owner of a [LEGO Mindstorms NXT 2.0 8547](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B001V7RF9U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B001V7RF9U) set.  I [blogged](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-to-get-a-geek-for-christmas) about this set last month, when I was suggesting that it would make an ideal Christmas present for a geek, however, after getting some Amazon vouchers for my birthday, I decided to go ahead and order it.

I haven’t had much of a chance to play with it tonight, had a few other things on the go, but I will definitely be playing with this over the Christmas break, and I am really looking forward to it!

With the help of a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1593272162/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1593272162) that I also got for my birthday (thanks Andy!), one of the first things that I will be building is a Rubik Cube Solver.  I have seen lots of videos of this on YouTube, and I honestly think that it is amazing what you can do.

If you haven’t seen this in action, take a look at the video below:

This particular example is not the quickest or smoothest solver of Rubik Cubes, however, it is built with the LEGO pieces that comes with the set that I have, so for that reason, it is as good a place to start as any!

If you are interested in the unboxing and contents of the 8547 set, you can take a look at the photos below.
