On tonights stream, which was stream 100 (quite a milestone) I was joined by [Maurice Kevenaar](https://twitter.com/mkevenaar), who was showing us how to install/setup/use his new chocolatey-diff tool:

https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-diff

This is a PowerShell module, which makes it possible to quickly identify the differences between two package versions for a Chocolatey Package. This is especially useful for moderators who are reviewing packages in the moderation queue.

We showed how this can be used on both Windows and Mac.

There were some issues with Twitch this evening which is a little unfortunate, but we made the most of it.  Maurice and I were able to continue chatting even though the connection to Twitch was failing.
