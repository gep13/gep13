Had a little bit of a movie marathon today, went to see both:

- [Hell Boy II: The Golden Army](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411477/)
- [The Dark Knight](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569/)

Let me first say that I really enjoyed the first Hell Boy movie, but I was a little bit let down by this film!! I really can't put my finger on why I didn't like it, but I just didn't like it. I have spoken to a few people since who have said that they really enjoyed it, so maybe I missed something,but.....

Following Hell Boy, I was on a bit of a downer, but then I watched The Dark Knight, and that feeling quickly went away, it was GREAT!!! At one point during the film, I thought that maybe it was going to stop, because I thought that the whole Harvey Dent alter ego would be the making of the next film, but they wrapped it all up in this one. All in all though, it was great!!!
