I am very happy to announce that yesterday, [along with 35 other new people, and nearly 1400 renewed people](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mvpawardprogram/2017/07/01/congratulations-mvps-july-17/?utm_source=t.co&utm_medium=referral), I was awarded with a Microsoft MVP Award!

For those of you who don't know, the Microsoft MVP Award, it is...

> our way of saying "Thanks!" to outstanding community leaders. The contributions MVPs make to the community, ranging from speaking engagements, to social media posts, to writing books, to helping others in online communities, have incredible impact.

If you are interested, you can find out more about it [here](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/Overview).

For a long time, I have often "thought" about being a Microsoft MVP, but I honestly never thought that I would be given one, so I am very happy to have received this.

When I found out the news yesterday, I was very excited.  I had literally just found out that a friend of mine, [Mattias](https://twitter.com/devlead/status/881201782109728768), had also been awarded with an MVP.  When I checked my email, I found that I too had received one.

I am looking forward to getting involved in the MVP Community, and continuing to contribute in the next year.

Congratulations to all the other new, and renewed, MVP's!
