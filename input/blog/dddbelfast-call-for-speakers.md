Hot on the heels of the [announcement](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/dddnorth-call-for-speakers) from #DDDNorth that they are accepting submissions from potential speakers, I have just found out the #DDDBelfast are doing the same [thing](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/dddie11/).

This conference is set to take place on Saturday 1st October 2011 at the University of Ulster.

For the same reason that I will not be able to attend #DDDNorth, I will also not be able to attend #DDDBelfast, which is a great shame as I would have loved to attend.

October is shaping up to be a very busy month for conferences/events:

- Saturday 1st October: DDD Belfast
- Saturday 8th October: DDD North
- Friday 21st to Sunday 23rd October: GiveCamp UK

Throw into the mix the fact that the [Microsoft BUILD conference](http://www.buildwindows.com) is going to be held on Tuesday 12th September and you can see that there is a lot of stuff happening in the near future.  As someone who likes to try to attend all conferences and events in order to learn as much as I possibly can, I do think that 3 events back to back in October might be a little bit too much. It might perhaps be better to space these out so that there is only 1 per month, but at the same time, given that these events are put on free for the community, we really can’t complain too much.
