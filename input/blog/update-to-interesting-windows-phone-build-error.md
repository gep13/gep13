# Windows Phone 8 handling of WPAppmanifest.xml has changed in Visual Studio 2012

Last year, I [blogged about an interesting build error](http://gep13.me/VoDIGy) that I had noticed in a Windows Phone 7 application that I was creating.  This error circled around a problem that occurred when you had a very long name in the author property within the WMAppManifest.xml file.  The error that was reported in the Error Window was fairly cryptic:

> “Manifest validation failed: AppManifestInvalidAuthor”

But after a bit of googling, I was able to find out what the problem was.  In all honesty, it was a very rare error, and it came down to a naming convention that I was using for a set of sample applications that I was creating, however, it was still slightly annoying!

# Things are better in Visual Studio 2012

I am happy to report, that things have improved, a lot, in this area within Visual Studio 2012.  Firstly, you don't have to edit the WMAppManifest.xml file by hand.  Visual Studio 2012 now includes a designer that sits on top of this XML file, as shown here:

<div id="flickrembed"></div><small style="display: block; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;">Powered by <a href="https://flickrembed.com">flickr embed</a>.</small>

<script src="https://flickrembed.com/embed_v2.js.php?source=flickr&layout=responsive&input=72157676140964522&sort=0&by=album&theme=default&scale=fit&skin=default&id=5850544461b40"></script>

This editor exists for both Windows Phone 7.1 and Windows Phone 8.0 applications.  You can of course continue to edit the XML directly (if you are that way inclined):

![Edit WMAppManifest.xml directly](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2013/1/15/edit_WMAppManifest_File_Directly.png)

But doing so means that you lose the ability to get immediate feedback on the state of your WMAppManifest.xml file, as shown here:

![WMAppManifest Editor showing error](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2013/1/15/WMAppManifest_Editor_Error.png)

This is a really great addition to Visual Studio, and another example of how Microsoft are ensuring that the end to end development experience is getting much better.  I first noticed this type of editor on top of XML files in Visual Studio 2010 when doing SharePoint development, and this is another very welcome addition!
