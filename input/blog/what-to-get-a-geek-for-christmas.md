With the run up to Christmas I keep getting asked the same question...

What do you want for Christmas?

The typical answer that I give to this question is, “I don’t know, just get me vouchers”. I normally say Amazon vouchers, that way, when something does crop up that I quite fancy, nine times of out ten, Amazon, or an Amazon reseller will have it, and I just order it up.

There are a couple things that I have been thinking about purchasing lately, and some vouchers towards them would help out.

I have thought about getting this for a long time now, but never have, so I am thinking that this Christmas could be as good a time as any.

The second thing that I am thinking about is a [Netduino](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004FRZ4E6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B004FRZ4E6) board. I have absolutely no idea what I would actually create if I were to get one of these, but again, I just love the idea of being able to control “stuff” via the programs that I create. If I do end of getting one of these, I guess I should pick up the [Getting Started](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1449302459/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1449302459) book that goes along with it, that may I am less likely to blow things up!

What other geek related things are out there that could be a good shout for folks to get me for Christmas, or for me to buy for myself? I guess I am looking for something hardware related, not software.

Any ideas?
