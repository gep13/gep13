As some of you may know, I have been a big fan of [LearnVisualStudio.net](http://learnvisualstudio.net/) for some time now, and I have a Lifetime Subscription with them. Basically, this means that every time a new video gets created, I can download them free of charge.

They have recently released some new series of videos on such topics as Windows Phone 7 and Silverlight 4, so they are certainly not behind in their technology.

I just received an email informing me that it is their 9th Anniversary, and because of this, they are now offering a 30% discount on there subscriptions, so if you donâ€™t already have one, I would highly recommend that you take advantage of the offer.

With the discount, a 1 Year Membership is coming in at $48.97, and a lifetime subscription for $139.97.

Bargain!!
