# Full day developer session in Scotland

It is with great pleasure that I am able to tell you that, with the help of Scottish Developers, Microsoft Evangelists [Mike Taulty](http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx) and [Andy Wigley](http://andywigley.com/), are going to be doing a full day of sessions in Edinburgh on Saturday 1st June 2013.  It is expected that the day will run from 10am - 4pm, consisting of four different topics:

- **Windows 8** - The Developer Overview
- **Windows Phone 8** - The Developer Overview
- **Azure Mobile Services** - Quick, Easy, and Powerful Mobile Backends
- Architecting & Building Shared Code for Windows and Windows Phone

Currently, full details of the sessions, and what is going to be contained within them, is still being prepared, but if the session names are anything to go by, this is going to be a great day!  Registration for the day is open, and spaces are limited, so I would encourage you all to get registered as soon as possible.  You can find the registration page [here](http://mikeandandy2013-eorg.eventbrite.com/).

Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it as I will be moving into our new house the day before, but I look forward to hearing all about it!
