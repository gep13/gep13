In case you haven’t seen it, TypeMock are running a free Webinar entitled:

**“Test the Untestable: Tips for Easy Unit Testing”**

on the 27th June 2011 at 3 PM GMT. The link for signing up is [here](https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/365837051). All going well, I am planning on attending this event, but the way work has been going, I might have to give it a miss.

TypeMock Isloator is one of the licenses that we are able to give away at the [Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/), so if you have already been lucky enough to win one of these licenses, this Webinar will be a great way to get started using it.

The agenda for the meeting is as follows:

- Common problems with unit testing, and how to solve them
- Applying unit testing patterns to legacy code
- How to test the untestable
- Cutting fluff with Typemock Isolator’s powerful mocking capabilities
- How to mock (fake) any dependency (SharePoint, databases, file systems)

One attendee will receive a free license of Typemock Isolator and one attendee will receive a free unit testing t-shirt!
