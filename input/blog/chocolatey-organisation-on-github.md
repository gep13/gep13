# I am now member of the Chocolatey GitHub Organisation

Today was a HUGE day!  I was formally invited to join the Chocolatey Organisation on GitHub:

I have been interested in the Chocolatey project since raising my first [GitHub issue](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/first-github-issue) back in 2012.  Since then, I have helped out where I can with Chocolatey from submitting Pull Requests into the project, answering questions on the forums, and helping out with GitHub issues.

Today shows a huge amount of trust in me from the Chocolatey creator Rob Reynolds, and I am very grateful for this trust that he has in me.

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
