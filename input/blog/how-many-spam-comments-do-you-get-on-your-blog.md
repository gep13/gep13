For the last three months, the about of spam comments that I have been getting on my blog has been steadily increasing, as you can see here.

I use the wonderful [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) system to prevent the comments ever appearing on the actual blog post, so that isn’t really a problem, it is just the hassle of having to go and tidy them up!

I have what I would class as a low traffic blog, but I can only imagine how many spam comments other people have to deal with.

How many spam comments do you get?  What methods do you use to stop them?

Any advice would be gratefully received!

_EDIT:_ I have just added Disqus to my blog.  Let's see if that makes any difference.
