### Get it while it's hot!

You can find the latest release of Chocolatey GUI, version 0.16.0, in the useful [place](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ChocolateyGUI).

If you already have it installed, then simply do `choco upgrade chocolateygui`.

### So what's new?

The biggest addition to this release of Chocolatey GUI is the tile view.  You can now view packages in a tile format, which shows the icon of the underlying application, if there is one.  You can see an example of this here:

This has been a much sought after feature, so we are very happy to have this finally land.

The other biggest feature in this release in the increased amount of languages that are supported by Chocolatey GUI.  The supported languages now include:

* Russian
* French
* Norwegian
* Portuguese
* Dutch
* German
* Swedish
* Japanese
* Spanish

A huge thank you has to go out to everyone who has joined the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-gui/dashboard/) team to make this happen.  If you are interested in helping out in translating Chocolatey GUI into another language, then please reach out, and we can get that included in the next release.
