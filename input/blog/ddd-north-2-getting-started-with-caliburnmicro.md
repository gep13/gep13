# My Caliburn.Micro Talk at DDD North 2

On Saturday 13th October 2012, I did a talk entitled "Getting Started with Caliburn.Micro and Windows Phone 7". If you attended the session, and are interested in seeing either the slide deck, or the source code for the presentation, you can find this information below. If you did attend, let me say thank you very much, and I very much hope you enjoyed it!

# The Code

All the demonstrations that I did during the presentation can be found on my GitHub account [here](https://github.com/gep13/CaliburnMicroDemos). I have created wiki pages for each demonstration that talk you through how to complete the demo, you can find them [here](https://github.com/gep13/CaliburnMicroDemos/wiki).

# Feedback

Since I am still reasonably new to doing public speaking, I would welcome any additional feedback that anyone has on my talk. If you have any comments about what I did wrong, what I did right, what could be improved upon etc, I would be very grateful to hear them.
