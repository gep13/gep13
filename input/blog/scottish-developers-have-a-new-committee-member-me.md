I am happy to announce that I am now a fully signed up member of the [Scottish Developers User Group](http://scottishdevelopers.com/).  Over the last year, I have been working more and more with the guys at Scottish Developers (Andy Gibson – [@ARGibson](http://twitter.com/argibson), Craig Murphy – [@CAMURPHY](http://twitter.com/camurphy), and Colin Mackay – [@ColinMackay](http://twitter.com/camurphy)) in order to bring speakers to Scottish User Groups, and I was thrilled when I was invited to become a committee member!

Working directly with Scottish Developers has meant that we have been able to bring people like Scott Hanselman – [@shanselman](http://twitter.com/shanselman), Matt Lacey – [@mrlacey](http://twitter.com/mrlacey), Sebastien Lambla – [@serialseb](http://twitter.com/serialseb), Gill Cleeren – [@gillcleeren](http://twitter.com/gillcleeren), and Mark Rendle – [@markrendle](http://twitter.com/markrendle) to Scotland, to do User Group presentations.  This typically means doing a tour of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.  These events seem to have gone down really well, and this is definitely something that we are looking to continue.  It is much easier to get speakers to commit to a series of events in Scotland, rather than a single event, as it makes the trip more worthwhile.  If there is anyone in particular that you are interested in seeing in Scotland, feel free to get in touch, and we will see what we can do.

In addition to the regular monthly events, I will also be getting involved in helping with the setup and running of the Annual Events, such as DDD Scotland, and DunDDD, as well as the general day-to-day running of the User Group.  This doesn’t mean that I will be neglecting the [Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group](http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/).  This will continue to exist in it’s own right, and host regular monthly events.

I attended my first Scottish Developers Annual General Meeting on the 7th July 2012, where I was formally introduced as a committee members.  You can see photos from the day below.
