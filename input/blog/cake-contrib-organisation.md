# Cake-Contrib Organisation has been created on GitHub

Today I created the Cake-Contrib on GitHub:

![Cake-Contrib Organisation on GitHub](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2016/8/17/cake-contrib-organisation.png)

This has been created after the discussion that was had in this [blog post](http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/08/cake-contribution-organization).

This will allow the development of addin's for Cake that can be more easily maintained by all members of the community.

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
