When I joined Chocolatey, I knew I was going to be in for an exciting ride, and so far, I have not been disappointed.  To date, I have been able to work on some exciting new features that are due out later this year, and I attended the PowerShell Summit, and interacted directly with people using Chocolatey.  Looking forward, the thing I am most looking forward to in 2018 is [Chocolatey Fest](https://chocolateyfest.com/).

## What is Chocolatey Fest?

Chocolatey Fest is the first ever independent conference in North America focused exclusively on Windows Automation (WinOps).  It is a one day event, which is going to be hosted at the Park Central Hotel in San Francisco, on the 8th October 2018.  I am planning on travelling to attend this event, and I very much looking forward to hearing about how people are using Chocolatey personally and in their Organisations, as well as the larger picture about Windows Automation.  I have a feeling that this is going to be a great event, and I would encourage you if you are in the area, to come along and join in.

If you are interested in attending, you can find the registration page [here](https://chocolateyfest.com/register).  Will yours be the Golden Ticket?

## Will Willy Wonka make an appearance?

You never know who you might see at the event:
