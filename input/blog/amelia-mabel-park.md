# Amelia Mabel Park

Lynn and I are very proud to announce the arrival of our second daughter Amelia Mabel Park.

She was born at 02:02 at the Aberdeen Maternity Ward. She weighed 7 pounds, 8 and 1/2 ounces.  Both Mum and Baby are doing very well.

Like her [sister](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/alivia-anne-park), Amelia has a very special birthday, in the sense that it is symmetrical, 17/2/17, where Alivia's birthday is 13/9/13.  There is something magical to me in how this has happened.

I am very much looking forward to bringing my amazing wife and new daughter home from the hospital.
