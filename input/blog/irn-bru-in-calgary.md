I didn't think I was going to find any Irn Bru while I was in Calgary, but guess what...

...I did!!

When I was at the Cinema last weekend to see the new Indiana Jones Movie, I saw the "A Taste of Britain" store. It was closed, but through the window I could see some Irn Bru. I went back there this Friday just past after work and I bought some.  It was £1.60 for a bottle, but it was well worth it!!!
