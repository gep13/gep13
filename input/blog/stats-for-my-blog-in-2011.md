2011 was my first year of doing what I would class as “proper” blogging.  I have had a blog for several years now, but it is only recently, with my increased involvement in the community, that I have been doing more blog posts.  I have every intention of continuing this in 2012, and with that in mind, I wanted to capture the stats for my blog in 2011, so that I can compare them next year.

Here are my Google Analytics results:

![Visitors Overview](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2012/1/1/image.png)

Highlights being:

- 4,482 Visits
- 3,018 Unique Visitors
- 7,201 Pageviews
- 1.61 Pages/Visit
- 00:01:49 Avg. Time on Site
- 75.46% Bounce Rate
- 66.87% % New Visits

And thanks to the JetPack addin that I use for my WordPress blog, other stats are:
