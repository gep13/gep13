Since I had such a good time at the zoo the first time, I thought it would be a good idea to take Lynn there as well!!

We had a great time, and you can see the photos from here:

It is a long story, but there is also a 20 minute video of me being dressed up as a tiger, and basically being humiliated, still haven't found a way of showing this on my site, but I think it will be making its way onto Lynn's Bebo page at some point, so keep your eyes open for it, it is quite funny!

We also got stuck in a hail storm while on our way back from the zoo, but not to worry, we bought some very sexy white ponchos to protect us!!
