I went to see two films today....

[The Happening](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949731/)

[The Incredible Hulk](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/)

Have to say that I didn't really enjoy The Happening. I can see what they were trying to do with the film, but just don't think that it came off very well. It was worth a watch, but not great!!

Really enjoyed The Incredible Hulk. The way the film ended it seems like there is going to be another one made, so will have to wait and see on that one.

Saw a couple of trailers for some upcoming films that I really want to go and see, namely:

[The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor](http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/08/4808/summary.php), I am a big fan of this series, so really looking forward to it!

[The X-Files: I want to believe](http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/65/2065/summary.php), again, big fan of all things X-Files, so hopefully this film along with Billy Connolly can live up to the name!!
