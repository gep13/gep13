I finally got round to finishing reading the [third in the series of books from Stuart MacBride](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Broken-Skin-Stuart-MacBride/dp/0007193173/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1220410166&amp;sr=8-2). I have had this book for ages, and I have started reading it a couple of times, but I just haven't been able to finish it.

Started reading it this morning, and once I had started, I couldn't put it down, so needless to say it was very good!!

I have been a big fan of these books since I picked up the first one on my way to Singapore. This isn't simply because the stories are based in Aberdeen, but because they are just VERY well written, and this one is no exception.

Would recommend it to anyone!! If you need any help with translating the Doric, let me know.
