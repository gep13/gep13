In case you hadn’t heard the DDD Conference, which this year has visited [Reading](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/a-review-of-ddd9-by-a-ddd-virgin), [Glasgow](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/a-review-of-dddscot-by-a-dddscot-virgin) and [Bristol](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/a-review-of-dddsw-by-a-dddsw-virgin), is now coming to [Sunderland](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Default.aspx). This is going to take place on Saturday 8th October 2011, at the University of Sunderland.

Unfortunately, I am not going to be able to make it to this event, I have already committed to going to [GiveCamp UK](http://www.givecamp.org.uk/) later in October, and I can’t make both. However, if it is anything like the other DDD Conferences then I would highly recommend that you go along!!

Registration for the event is not open yet, however, they are accepting submissions for speakers on the day, so if you have a topic that you want to talk about, now is your chance to get a foot in the door.

To find out more information about the event check out the [website](http://www.developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north/Default.aspx) or you can follow [@DDDNorth](http://twitter.com/dddnorth), or you can use the #DDDNorth hash tag.
