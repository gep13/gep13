## Going on the road

Starting in January, and I am going to be doing something that I have never done before...  Visiting a number of User Groups around the world doing talks.

I have done the odd talk here and there over the years, but this tour will see me hitting 6 different venues in just under 2 weeks.  As you might well imagine, I am really looking forward to this!

The following are the list of places that you can find me, along with some stickers to give away!  (Who doesn't like stickers!)

### KC .NET User Group

While visting the States for a week, I am going to be attending the Kansas City .NET User Group on the 30th January 2018 to do a presentation on [Cake](https://cakebuild.net/).
