Since setting up my personal Twitter account and an account for Aberdeen Developers, I have been playing with an application called TweetDeck, available [here](http://www.tweetdeck.com/beta/). 

I have set it up so that it has both these Twitter accounts, as well as my Facebook and LinkedIn accounts. There is also the option of adding a Foursqaure account, a Google Buzz account and a MySpace account, none of which I have. But now the question, do I need one….

Has social networking got to the point that there are now just too many separate accounts in order to be useful, and what’s needed is a third party application, such as TweetDeck, which by the way I had to set up an account for, in order to stitch them altogether?
