Lynn had organised tickets to go and see [Vampires Rock](http://www.vampiresrock.com/index.htm) tonight. I had no idea what it was all about, so had no idea what to expect, but I have to say that it was really good!!!

Steve Steinman, the guy who runs it, also does a Meatloaf Tour which Lynn had also been to, that is how she know about Vampires Rock. It was basically a musical, that followed the story of the Baron, and how he is looking for a new mate. The difference being that the songs are all classic rock songs. It was all very well done!!!

The production also included Toya Wilcox, who also did a great job.

I have to be honest, at the start, I thought the band was faking playing the instruments, but it became clear that they definitely weren't, they were just very talented. The band was called the Lost Boys.

Steinman is coming back to Aberdeen in April next year for another show which I think we are going to go along to as well.

We hung around after the performance and got some autographs, and I got my photo taken with one of the dancers:
