A few days ago, I got this notification on my Mac:

![Should I do this](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/10/23/should-i-do-this.jpg_large)

Since getting my Mac at the start of this year when I started working for Chocolatey Software, Inc, this is the first major operating system update that I have been presented with, so I was a little anxious.

I reached out to Twitter, and the overall responses seemed to be positive, so I thought I would go for it.

After making sure that everything was backed up via Time Machine, and Backblaze, I clicked the install button...

## How did it go?

I am happy to say that overall, the process was fairly straight forward, as shown in the series to screenshots below.

Where did I put that power cord?

How good is the Apple Random Number Generator?

Turns out it was pretty good!

At this point, the Mac restarted a couple times, and proceeded to show the Apple Icon for about 30 minutes, while it did it's work.

After selecting a few options, including selecting the new Dark Theme, I was welcomed with this:

Having played with it for a little while now, everything seems to be working fine.  The only slight issue that I have noticed is that when starting up some applications, I see something that looks like the following:

![Access the microphone](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/10/23/access-the-microphone.png)

I believe in this latest version of the Operating System there are some additional permissions that applications need to request in order to continue doing what they were doing before.  I have seen this also pop up on applications like VMWare Fusion, Slack, etc.  Seems to be anything that has the ability to interact with the hardware of the machine.
