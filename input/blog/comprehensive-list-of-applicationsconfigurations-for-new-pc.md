In the last 3 months, I have had to rebuild 3 separate PC’s, from scratch, i.e. re-format the hard drive, re-install OS, and put all applications back on again.  All of them have been development rigs, my home desktop, my personal laptop, and work development machine.

Each time I did this, I had to think about what applications I wanted to install, and what configuration changes I have to make to each application once installed.  What was missing is a comprehensive list of what to install, and what to configure, so this is where this blog post is going to come in.

It will serve as a reference to me when I need to re-install again.  My aim is to keep it up to date with any “new” applications I add to my systems.  The order in which the applications appear in their groups is typically the order in which I install them.

**NOTE: **Most Applications are freely available on the Internet, however, some are licensed directly to me, either through an MSDN Subscription, or applications which I have personally bought, so please ensure you have the necessary licenses to use any of the below applications.

- Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit Edition
