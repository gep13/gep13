Today was a very special day, it was the day that I was made the happiest man alive.  Today, Lynn and I got married.

The service took place at the Cruden Parish Church.  It was a beautiful day, although a little cold.  Especially when our photographer, Susan Renee, decided it would be a good idea to get some photos down beside the sea.  The reception was held at the Tufted Duck Hotel.

A fantastic day all around though.  Thank you to everyone for being there, and sharing the day with us.
