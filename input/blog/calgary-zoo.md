Today I visited the Calgary Zoo. Really enjoyed myself there!! Must have spent about 5 hours just wandering round the place trying to see all the animals.

Was really impressed with how easy it was to get to the Zoo. Jumped on the C Train at 7th Street, and a couple stops later I was at the Zoo Station, and then a short walk took me into the Zoo itself. Really very easy. Don't think it would be that easy to get to the Zoo's back home! You can see some of the photos that I took at the Zoo below. Be warned though, there are quite a few of them!!!
