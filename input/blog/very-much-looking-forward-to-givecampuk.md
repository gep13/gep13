In case you haven’t heard about it, there is a very exciting event coming up on the weekend of the 21st October 2011. It’s called GiveCampUK:

[http://www.givecamp.org.uk/](http://www.givecamp.org.uk/)

The idea behind this event, which was first started in Dallas, Texas, is that a bunch of like minded developers get together and help out a group of charities and non-profit organisations with their technology requirements. My understanding is that this could range from creating a website from scratch to deploying a WordPress Blog that they require for their site.

At present, the event has fulfilled it’s quota for required volunteers (developers, designers and database administrators), but if you are interested, you can still [sign up](http://www.givecamp.org.uk/volunteer) to be on a shortlist in case some people have to drop out.

I am delighted to say that I have made it onto the list and I am very much looking forward to taking part in the event, although, having never done anything like this before, I have to admit that I am a little bit nervous. What makes it worse is that I know that there are a lot of VERY talented developers taking part in the event. This is great for the charities, as they will get the benefit of the wealth of their combined experience, but from a personal stand point, it does make it a little intimidating.

However, I am determined to make this most of this experience, as I firmly believe that I will get as much out of this, as hopefully the charities will get from me. It is a great chance to socialise with and learn from other developers, and be exposed to technologies and processes that I might otherwise not have seen.

For more information on the event, you can find the organisers on Twitter ([@GiveCampUK](http://twitter.com/#!/givecampuk)) and [FaceBook](http://www.facebook.com/GiveCampUK).
