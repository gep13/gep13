Went to see the new Jason Statham movie, Death Race, last night. It was actually really good, a total guy film, and definitely worth watching. Just the right amount of humour, gore, cars and general violence. There was enough of a story to keep you interested, and enough action to make you want to stay until the end. The ending was maybe a little too clean in the sense that everyone walked away happy, but apart from that, definitely worth the ticket price.
