For the last few weeks, I have been getting in contact with various companies to try to drum up some support for the [Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/).

I have been able to confirm some of the swag that we will now be able to give away at each of the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group Meetings.Â  During each event, I will have great pleasure in giving away the following:

- Telerik
  - [Telerik Ultimate Collection for .Net](http://www.telerik.com/purchase.aspx)
- [DevExpress CodeRush License](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/Visual_Studio_Add-in/Coding_Assistance/)
- [TypeMock Isolator License](http://www.typemock.com/typemock-isolator-product3)
- Mindscape
  - [Any Mindscape Product](http://www.mindscapehq.com/products)
- [JetBrains ReSharper License](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/)
- [pluralsight Coupon Codes](http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/)

For your chance to win one of the above, all you have to do is register and turn up for one of our User Group Meetings.
In addition, I have also been able to establish a User Group discount for the purchase of books through Manning Books:

[http://www.manning.com/](http://www.manning.com/)

I will give some more details out about this on the night, but this will ONLY be available to registered members of the site, so if you haven't yet registered with us, then I strongly suggest that you do so, as we can get a 36% for all purchases.

And thanks again to all of our [sponsors](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/sponsors/) for their generosity and support of our .Net User Group!!
