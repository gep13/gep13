# Achievement unlocked!

I am a big fan of the .Net Rocks podcast, I have been listening for longer than I can remember, and I was blown away when I was able to arrange an appearance on the show to discuss [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/).  As some of you may know, Carl and Richard have a recording booth at [NDC Oslo](http://ndcoslo.com/) where they are able to record a number of shows back to back, when everyone is in the same place, and I was lucky enough to get selected.

# The show

The show has just been published, and you can find it [here](https://www.dotnetrocks.com/?show=1321).  All in all, it was great fun doing the show.  Both Carl and Richard are seasoned professionals, and make it very easy to talk about the topic at hand.  I had just finished presenting my talk at NDC Oslo, so I was already buzzing, so I might come across as a little over excited, but I hope you enjoy it.

# The $5000 question

I had put a lot of thought into the question, but in the end I sort of wimped out, as I wasn't really able to think of anything.  In fairness though, everyone likes playing with toys, so it wouldn't be a complete waste of money!
