# What were the stats?

Last year around this time, I wrote a blog post about the stats for my blog in 2011, you can see this blog post [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/stats-for-my-blog-in-2011).

It is now time to see what the stats were for 2012 and compare these to the previous years stats.

First up, what does Google Analytics have to say about it:

![Google Analytics Results](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2012/12/31/Google_Analytics_Results.png)

Highlights being:

- 7,616 Visits (an increase of 3,134 on last year)
- 6,252 Unique Visitors (an increase of 3,23 on last year)
- 10,485 Pageviews (an increase of 3,284 on last year)
- 1.38 Pages/Visit (a decrease of 0.23 on last year)
- 00:01:42 Avg. Time on Site (a decrease of 00:00:07 on last year)
- 72.87% Bounce Rate (a decrease of 2.59% on last year)
- 80.53% % of New Visits (an increase of 13.66% on last year)

Overall, I am really happy with these results.  I spent a lot more time working on the blog this year, and I am pleased to see an increase in traffic to the blog.

Thanks again to the amazing [Jetpack plugin for WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jetpack/), I am able to share some more stats:

My top 5 blog posts were:

- [Scott Hanselman doing user group tour of Scotland](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/scott-hanselman-doing-user-group-tour-of-scotland)
- [Sebastien Lambla on tour](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/sebastien-lambla-on-tour)
- [UK Developer Events for 2012](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/uk-developer-events-for-2012)
- [Use the Cloud9 Online IDE to hack on WordPress](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/use-the-cloud9-online-ide-to-hack-on-wordpress)
- [DDD attendance leaderboard, where do you rank?](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/ddd-attendance-leaderboard-where-do-you-rank)

In 2012, there were actually 28 posts fewer than in 2011.  However, the busy day increased to 410 views, compared to 279 views in 2011.

The keen-eyed amongst you will notice that 93 (the total number of posts at the end of 2011) plus, the total number of posts of 2012 which was 53, does not equal the total number of posts at the end of 2012 which was 229.  The reason for this is that during 2012, I copied some blog posts from an older incarnation of the gep13 blog, and added them here.

Finally, just wanted to wish everyone a Happy New Year, and all the best for 2013!
