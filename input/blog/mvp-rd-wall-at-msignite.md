Last week there was a flurry of pictures on Twitter and Facebook from the [Microsoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite) Conference, and one in particular caught my eye.

# MVP and RD Wall

It was this picture:

It was pointed out to me on Twitter by [Jan Karger](https://twitter.com/punker76/status/1044343384503209988) that my name was included in the wall.  A quick check, and indeed I could see my name:

I had no idea that Microsoft did this, and I really think it is a nice touch, to show appreciation to all the MVP's and Regional Directors.
