Just picked up my new phone.

I opted to go for the new Sony Ericsson X1, you can find details about it [here](http://www.sonyericsson.com/x1/). I haven't really had a chance to play with it yet, but so far, I am very impressed. Debated for a long time about getting the iPhone, but decided that I was more than likely going to run the battery down on that cause I am listening to music, and then I wouldn't be able to make a phone call or a send a text message, so better to keep my phone and music as two separate devices.
