It doesn’t seem that long ago since the last DDD Events in October, but it is now time for another one! This time it is [DunDDD](http://dundee.dddscotland.co.uk/), a DDD event in Dundee, Scotland.

After the success of the [NoSQL Autumn Conference](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/nosql-autumn-conference-2010dundee) that was held in Dundee last year, [Scottish Developers](http://scottishdevelopers.com/) have teamed up with them to bring you a 15 session event spread over 3 tracks is to be held on the 19th November 2011. One of the tracks is solely dedicated to NoSQL. Have a look at the [session](http://dundee.dddscotland.co.uk/lineup) information and [agenda](http://dundee.dddscotland.co.uk/lineup/agenda), for full information about what will be happening on the day.

Best of all, as with all the DDD Events, DunDDD is completely free, so there is really no excuse not to attend. If you are interested in attending DunDDD make sure you visit the website to register to ensure that you will get a space.
