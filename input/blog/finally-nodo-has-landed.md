So, after weeks of waiting, the Nodo update has finally landed on my HTC HD7.

I didn’t get any notification on my phone, but after a day of reading tweets from people I knew were on O2 who had the update, I decided to plug my phone into computer and let the Zune software check for an update, and this is what I was greeted with:

![Update Available](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/4/6/image.png)

Clicking the UPDATE button took me through to here:

![Update your phone](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/4/6/image_3.png)

And after a quick prayer, and a deep breath, I clicked the UPDATE NOW button:

I missed some steps as they happened so quickly:

![Step 5 of 10](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/4/6/image_5.png)

![Step 6 of 10](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/4/6/image_6.png)

This step took quite a while:

This step took even longer (go and get yourself a cup of tea):

![Step 8 of 10](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/4/6/image_8.png)

![Step 9 of 10](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/4/6/image_9.png)

![Step 10 of 10](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/4/6/image_10.png)

![You can now disconnect your phone](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/4/6/image_11.png)

Woot!!

Upon checking Settings | about, the OS version of my HTC HD7 is now 7.0.7390.0.
