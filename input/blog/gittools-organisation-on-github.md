# New GitTools Organisation created on GitHub

Today the [GitTools organisation](https://github.com/GitTools) was created on GitHub.

![GitTools GitHub Organisation](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2015/4/15/gittools-organisation.png)

This organisation houses several tools related to the git distributed source control system:

- [GitVersion](https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion)
- [GitLink](https://github.com/GitTools/GitLink)
- [GitReleaseManager](https://github.com/GitTools/GitReleaseManager)
- [GitReleaseNotes](https://github.com/GitTools/GitReleaseNotes)
- As well as some supporting libraries in other repositories

Prior to this organisation being created, these projects existed in individual persons repositories.  However, given the overlap between the projects, it was decided that a central location was required, so that all projects could benefit from the shared knowledge.

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
