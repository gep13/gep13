After a long flight (3 films worth :-)) arrived in Calgary Airport at 1930 Hours local time. Had to get my work permit issued before I could get out the airport, but there weren't any problems there. Got in a taxi and got him to drive me past the office so I would know where I was going in the morning, and then got him to take me to the Sandman Hotel, where I would be spending the next few nights.
