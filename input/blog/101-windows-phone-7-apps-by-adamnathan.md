Earlier this year I bought “[101 Windows Phone 7 Apps, Volume 1](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0672335522/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0672335522)” by Adam Nathan ([@adamnathan](https://twitter.com/#!/adamnathan)), and I have to say that I absolutely loved it!  Although it can only be described as a tomb, coming in at 1130 pages, it is a great read!  It is delivered in full colour, making it very easy to read, and all the sample code is available for all the applications.  The book starts off slowly, for instance the second application is the dreaded Flashlight application (the Hello World Application for Windows Phone 7) and moves through to more complicated applications like a Jigsaw Puzzle which utilises Drag and Drop features.

Thanks to an email this morning from Amazon, I have just pre-ordered the “[101 Windows Phone 7 Apps, Volume 2](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0672335603/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0672335603)” which I am very much looking forward to reading!  I have a few books that I was going to be reading over the Christmas break, but this one will be making it to the top of the pile.

The only thing that I would say is, and this is directed at Sams Publishing rather than Adam, it would be great if they could offer deals similar to [Apress](https://www.apress.com/) and [O’Reilly](https://oreilly.com/) where having bought the print book, you can then purchase a companion digital version of the book for a reduced price, rather than paying full price for it again!  This would be especially useful for books of this size as it would mean that you could search the book on your computer when looking for something particular.
