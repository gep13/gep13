Over the last week or so, there have been a number of interesting announcements coming out of the Microsoft camp.

They have announced:

- [IIS Express](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/06/28/introducing-iis-express.aspx)
- [Embedded Database Support with ASP.Net](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/06/30/new-embedded-database-support-with-asp-net.aspx)
- [New View Engine for ASP.Net](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx)
- [Silverlight PivotViewer](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/06/29/silverlight-pivotviewer-now-available.aspx)
- [WebMatrix](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/06/introducing-webmatrix.aspx)

All very exciting announcements!!

There is a public beta of WebMatrix available [here](http://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/download), however, betas for the other products are still waiting to be released (which the exception of PivotViewer, which is already available for [download](http://www.silverlight.net/learn/pivotviewer)).

I am particularly interested in taking a look at IIS Express and the Embedded Database Supported that comes with SQL Server Compact Edition 4, and I will be trying these out once the beta is released.
