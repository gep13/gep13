# Call For Speakers

The Call For Speakers for DDD Scotland is now fully open.  If you have a topic that you would like to speak on, then now is your opportunity to register the talk for consideration.

For those of you who are not familiar with the format of DDD events, it goes a little something like this...

- Potential Speakers submit their sessions for consideration
- Community Voting is then opened, and the Community decides on which talks they want to see
- The speakers with the sessions with the most votes are then contacted, and the sessions are then scheduled

If you haven't been to a DDD event before, I thoroughly recommend to give one a try.  They really are great fun!

If you want more information about the event you can find information on the [website](http://ddd.scot ) or reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dddscot).
