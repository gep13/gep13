Back in October of 2011, I dropped an email to Matt Lacey, of the [Windows Phone User Group](http://wpug.net/), asking whether he would be interested in doing a talk up in Scotland at the [Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group](http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/).  This was a bit of a long shot, but I was always brought up with the saying, “If you don’t ask, you don’t get”, so I thought the worst that he could say would be “No”.

I am thrilled to say that Matt agreed that coming up to Aberdeen would certainly be a possibility, and in fact, he would be interested in doing a tour of the user groups up in Scotland.  Once again, with the help of the [Scottish Meetup Network](http://aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/post/2011/12/10/Scottish-Meetup-Network.aspx), I am delighted to say that we have been able to secure Matt to do 3 User Group Sessions.

The schedule for the tour breaks down as follows:

- **Tuesday 21 February**
  - [What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - BCS Edinburgh and Scottish Developers](http://www.edinburgh.bcs.org/events/2011-12/120221.htm)
- **Wednesday 22nd February**
  - [What and why every developer needs to know about mobile development - Dundee Web Standards](http://dwsmattlacey.eventbrite.com/)
- **Thursday 23rd February**
  - [Getting started with Windows Phone – Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group](http://adnuguk-feb2012.eventbrite.com/?ref=ebtn)

This is a very busy schedule, and hopefully you will be able to catch Matt at one of the above events.  I will update the above with links to full details of all the above events as and when they become available.

If you require any additional information about the above tour, please feel free to get in touch.
