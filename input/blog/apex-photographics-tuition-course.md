As a birthday gift last year I was given a 4 hour Photography Training Course with Apex Photographics (thank you again Caroline!).  You can find their website [here](http://apexphotographics.co.uk/).  After finally sitting down to decide when I will be doing this course, I have decided to go along on Monday 6th February.  I had originally booked it for Saturday 4th, but due to the fact that I am now attending [UK Tech Days](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/i-am-attending-the-uk-tech-days-in-london) in London, I am not able to make it at the weekend.  I have no idea what to expect from the course, as I haven’t taken any proper pictures for a long time now (you can see some of my efforts on flickr [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/gep13/)), but I am very much looking forward to learning something new.  I will post back once I have attended the tuition, and I will upload some of the photos that I take.

On another note, after hearing the news that the Nikon [D700 is being discontinued](http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/nikon-d700-d300s-discontinued-1057814?src=rss&attr=all), now is maybe a good time to start thinking about a new camera as well.
