Just tried to open MetroTwit this morning and I was greeted with what can only be described as one of the nicest looking, and most polite error messages that I have seen in a while. Here it is:

![Something went wrong, very wrong](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/6/6/image.png)

The more detailed error message shows:

![Detailed Error](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/6/6/image1.png)

Just tried opening and closing the application but I get the same thing. Looks like I will have to revert to using the Twitter web site for now, but I will try MetroTwit again later.

Could this be a sign that the eagerly awaited Nest is making some changes, or is it more likely that new IT changes that came in over the weekend now prevent me from using Twitter at work.
