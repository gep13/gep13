It is hard to believe, but [GiveCamp UK](http://www.givecamp.org.uk/) is now only a four days away. If you haven’t seen it already, the list of Charities and Projects that are going to be involved can be found [here](http://www.givecamp.org.uk/blog/introducing-our-givecamp-uk-2011-charity-projects). I am really looking forward to finding out what Project I am going to be working on, and how I am going to be able to help out!!

With the day fast approaching, it is making me wonder whether I have everything that I need installed on my laptop. So I thought I would create a list of the applications that I think I am going to need, and currently have installed. Then, through the power of Twitter and RSS, I am hoping that other GiveCamp UK attendees can make suggestions to add to the list, that way I will have everything installed that is required.

- UPDATE 1: Added additional clients for VCS's, as well as kDiff, WinMerge (see [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/visual-studio-2010-compare-and-merge-tool-configuration) for Visual Studio setup) and Putty 
- UPDATE 2: Twitter Client added to the list 
- UPDATE 3: Added more VCS Clients to the list 
- UPDATE 4: Added some notes following feedback from attending GiveCamp UK, as well as pieces of hardware you might want to bring with you

NOTE: If you are going to be using Git or Mercurial, then in all likelihood you are going to be using something like GitHub or BitBucket. Make sure you have an account for these websites set up ahead of time.

**Hardware**

In addition to the software listed above, you might also want to think about taking the following pieces of hardware:
    
- Network Hub/Switch - for use by your team members 
- Multi Gang Power Extension Lead - in case there are limited plugs available 
- Headphones 
- Your own keyboard - if like me you use an ergonomic keyboard 

Am I missing anything important that will be required for use at GiveCamp? I will update this blog post as I think about new things, and as suggestions are made.
