Whilst waiting to try to get into the tour of the Glasgow City Chambers (which ended up not happening, only runs on week days) I took some photos with my new phone. I was quite surprised by the quality of some of the photos. I have added them below,so feel free to have a look.

While I was there, there was a marching band that led a procession for placing a poppy wreath at the base of the statue. That was interesting to watch.
