If I had to sum up this film in one word, what would it be?

HILARIOUS!!!!

Me and Lynn went to see [Step Brothers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0838283/) today, and I think I can say that we both really enjoyed it!! It was really funny, Will Ferrell and John Reilly did a great job of playing the characters. The beating up of the school yard bullies at the end of the film was maybe a little over the top, but all in all, a great film!!!
