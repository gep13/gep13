# Having your cake, and eating it too!

Today I gave a talk entitled "Having your Cake, and eating it too!" at [DDD Scotland](http://ddd.scot/).  This was the first year that DDD Scotland has been back for a long time, and I was particularly happy to be asked along to present at this event.

To add an additional level of pressure, the session was being recorded and should be available on the Channel 9 website once edited.

# The Code

If you are interested in following along with the demos that I gave during this talk, you can find all the information in my [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gep13/CakeDemos).
