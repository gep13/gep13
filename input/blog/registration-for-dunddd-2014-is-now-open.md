The call for speakers at the Scottish Community Event (organised by the [Scottish Developers](http://scottishdevelopers.com/)) known as [DunDDD ](http://dun.dddscotland.co.uk/speaker)has now closed and the registration has opened.

# DunDDD is now in its fourth year

This will be the 4th DunDDD, built on the popular foundation of the Developer! Developer! Developer! conference series which has spread to all corners of the UK and the international arena. Â DDD conferences are community-run days where passionate and enthusiastic people come together to learn, share ideas, and to network within the many hubs of the development community. Best of all DDD events are **free** to everyone!

This year DunDDD will be featuring an entire track dedicated to the **Not Only SQL** movement and **Big Data**.
