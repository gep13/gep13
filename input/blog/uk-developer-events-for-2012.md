As part of my work goals, I have been compiling a list of UK Developer Conferences/Events that are happening this year, and trying to decide which, if any, I can attend.  Note, I am not saying that this is a complete list of events.  In fact, this is just the opposite.  This is a list of events that I am aware of, and I would like to know about any that I have not listed here, see note at the end of the blog post.  I have not included any Local User Group Events in this list, as that would make for a very long list.  This list is limited to upcoming conferences which are between 1 and 5 days in duration.  If you are interested in finding Local User Group Events, you might want to check out this [calendar](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/page/Scottish-Meetings.aspx) which posts a number of upcoming events.

Once I know exact details for these events, in terms of exact dates, venues, websites, registration, etc, I will be updating this post.  More for the sake of my own sanity, so I don’t have to go digging around to find it again, but hopefully it will prove useful for you as well.  The events appear in “roughly” a chronological order, based on what I do know, but this will likely change around as the dates get confirmed.
