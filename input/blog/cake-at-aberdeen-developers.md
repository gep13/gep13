# Having your cake, and eating it too!

Tonight I gave a talk entitled "Having your Cake, and eating it too!" at Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group.  You can find out more about this local .Net User Group on the [website](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/).

This was really a dry run for the talk that I will be giving later in the year at [NDC Oslo](http://ndcoslo.com/).
