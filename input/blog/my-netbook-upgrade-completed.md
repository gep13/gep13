In yesterdays [blog post](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/upgrading-the-ram-on-my-new-netbook) I mentioned how I was having some problems getting my shiny new 2 GB RAM for my ASUS 1015 PX working. I am happy to report that I now have it working!

Following a number of useful comments on the blog post, I set about trying a couple of things.

Firstly, I downloaded and installed [CPU-Z](http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html), a freeware application that gathers information on some of the main devices on a system. This confirmed for sure that Windows 7 Starter was only seeing 1 GB of RAM.

The next plan of attack was to go into BIOS to make sure that there wasn’t something in there that had to be changed. But then came the inevitable question, which button gets you into BIOS? Is it F2? Is it Del? Is it Insert? After about 5 minutes of various different keyboard mashing and reboots, I was still unable to get into BIOS. A quick Google confirmed that there was no secret ASUS keyboard shortcut to get into BIOS, but I still couldn’t get into.

In a hopeless attempt, I decided to turn off the “Fast Boot” option (the option that allows me to choose between booting into Windows as normal or a Linux Distro). When I did this and rebooted the machine, the standard screen that says hit F2 to go into BIOS returned, hurrah!!

Once in there I still couldn’t see any options to change anything to do with Memory.

Just as I was away to come out and try something else, I noticed on the main screen that the reported amount of RAM on the System was 2 GB! Weird!

So I decided to head back into Windows, on the off chance that simply going into BIOS (or turning the “Fast Boot” option off) had resulted in the full 2 GB of RAM was now being reported, and guess what...

It is!!!

Now, part of me is curious as to what is going on here, so if anyone knows, I would be very interested to know, another part of me is just glad that it is working, and that I don’t have to go through the hassle of trying to return the RAM.
