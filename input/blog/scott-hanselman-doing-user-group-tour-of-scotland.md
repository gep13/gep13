# No, really, scott hanselman is coming to Scotland

I am **very** happy to announce that [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com) ([@shanselman](https://twitter.com/#!/shanselman)) is doing a User Group tour of Scotland in July.  He is going to be over here for 1 week, and while he is here he is going to be doing 4 User Group sessions.  The details for these sessions are as follows:

##### **[9 July - Edinburgh](http://scott-hanselman-edi-2012.eventbrite.co.uk/?ref=gep13blog)**: Developing for the Mobile Web

Mobile traffic on the web is exploding. Are you ready? ASP.NET MVC 4 includes new mobile-friendly templates, a focus on responsive design as well as dedicated mobile templates that leverage jQuery and jQuery mobile. Scott Hanselman will show you what you can do today and tomorrow to make your site friendly on a mobile device. When should your mobile site become a mobile application? Should you use CSS3 media queries, or go "all in" and use jQuery mobile or another mobile framework?

##### **[10 July - Dundee](http://scott-hanselman-dee-2012.eventbrite.co.uk/?ref=gep13blog)**: Personal Productivity - Scaling yourself in the face of Information Overload

As information workers, we are asked to absorb even more information than ever before. More blogs, more documentation, more patterns, more layers of abstraction. Now Twitter and Facebook compete with Email and Texts for our attention, keeping us up-to-date on our friends dietary details and movie attendance second-by-second. Does all this information take a toll on your psyche or sharpen the saw? Is it a matter of finding the right tools and filters to capture what you need, or do you just need to unplug. Is ZEB (zero email bounce) a myth or are there substantive techniques for prioritizing your life one the web? Join Scott Hanselman as we explore how you can be truly productive.

##### **[12 July - Aberdeen](http://scott-hanselman-abz-2012.eventbrite.co.uk/?ref=gep13blog)**: One ASP.NET - Open Source, .NET and the Cloud

It's an exciting time for ASP.NET and Open Source. What does the next version of Visual Studio and ASP.NET bring to the world of web development? How will you use HTML5, CSS3 and new advances in JavaScript with ASP.NET? There’s new advances in ASP.NET with the addition of real-time (Signalr), new features in WebForms as well as support for mobile. How will it all snap together in a way that makes sense? Join Scott Hanselman as he shares some internal documents and exciting surprises about the future of ASP.NET. What about Azure? We'll talk about the world’s most misunderstood cloud and it means for developers of all flavours and persuasions.

# thanks

There are too many people to thank for helping to get this tour under way that I won’t be able to list them all here, but hopefully you know who you all are, and I very much appreciate all your help!!

# How did all this start?

A few of you might be wondering how this event got started, and I thought I should take the time to explain.  First up, a HUGE shout has to go out to Gregor Suttie ([@gsuttie](https://twitter.com/#!/gsuttie)), if it were not for him, this tour would not be happening.  Let me explain...

Through the wonders of Twitter, I was having a conversation with Gregor, and he happened to make a throw-away comment along the lines of “...wouldn’t it be great if [@shanselman](https://twitter.com/#!/shanselman) came to Scotland!”.  I quickly replied to him saying that yes, this would be great, but really, what are the chances.  Within a few minutes, Scott actually replied to Gregor’s tweet, asking what we were talking about.  We explained, and Scott then offered to talk the conversation offline, and provided me with his email address.  After a few emails it was clear that Scott was very interested in visiting Scotland as he has been able to trace his family tree back to Scotland, and we were only to happy to host him at our User Groups.  With some help from the [Scottish Developer](http://scottishdevelopers.com/) guys, plans were quickly put into place to host Scott at the four venues listed above.  Thanks again Gregor!!

Hopefully see you all there!
