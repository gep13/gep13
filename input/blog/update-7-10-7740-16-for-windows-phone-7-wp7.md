This morning, I switched on my phone, and it told me that there was an update available. It has only been a couple weeks since the [last update](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/update-7-10-7710-68-for-windows-phone-7-wp7), which provided me with the must needed ability to tether my phone to my laptop.

On plugging in my phone, and opening up Zune, I was presented with this:

![Update your phone](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/12/3/2011-12-03_0939.png)

So this update was the one that I thought the last one was, a bug fix update.

This wasnâ€™t a big update, and after about fifteen minutes, I got the following:

![Successful Update](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/12/3/2011-12-03_0956.png)

Simples!
