This blog post is one of a series of blogs on Visual Studio Addins that I use. To go back to the series index page, click [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/essential-visual-studio-2008-addin-series).

# PowerCommands

Personally, I think this Addin has a couple of little gems in it, that I quite simply wouldnâ€™t work without anymore, you can download it here:

[http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands)

All features are enabled by deafult, but you can enable/disable them to suit your needs under Tools | Options | PowerCommands.

This Addin includes things like:

- Insert Guid Attribute
- Collapse Projects
- Edit Project File
- Remove and Sort Usings

And many more.
