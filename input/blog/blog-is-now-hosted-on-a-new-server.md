I hope that everyone has had a great Christmas, and are looking forward to celebrating at New Year.

In the downtime since finishing up work before Christmas, I have been working my way through my to do list, and one of them was to update the WordPress system that hosts this blog.  In doing so, it became clear that there were some "issues" with the WordPress installation which was hosted with my Web Host.  I tried for some while to get this resolved, and wasn't able to.  In the end, I decided to move the hosting of this WordPress blog to my own Virtual Private Server, that I have through [Tagadab](http://tagadab.com/) (thanks again to [@agileguy](http://twitter.com/agileguy) for the recommendation!).

This transfer has now been completed, and from what I can see, the blog seems to working correctly.  If you find any issues, then please feel free to get in touch, and I will get them corrected.
