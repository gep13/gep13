## Is it really 1 year?

As amazing as it sounds, our daughter is 1 year old today!

I was always told that time would start passing quickly as soon as you had your first child, but I honestly didn't expect that it would be this fast!

Today is Alivia's 1st Birthday!  I can remember being in the hospital holding for the first time as if it were yesterday!

So much as happened since Alivia came into our lives, but I wouldn't change anything, I love being a dad!

She has:

- learned to walk (well almost)
- learned to swim
- learned to say "dad"
- learned to sign "mum"
- learned to clap
- learned to sleep through the night
- learned to blow raspberries
- and so much more!

Looking forward to teaching her so many new things in the next year!
