**_UPDATE: _**I am happy to report that the DDD North 2 Agenda Application is now available on the Marketplace.  You can find it [here](http://windowsphone.com/s?appid=7364a248-8439-4795-b276-809f00af9775).  This link seems to work when browsing the marketplace on your phone, but it doesn't seem to work when doing it from my laptop just now.

Are you going to DDD North 2?  Do you have a Windows Phone 7?  If so, then you need to get yourself the DDD North 2 Windows Phone 7 application.  At this point, I would normally give you a link to where you can download the application from the marketplace, however, there is a chance that the application will not be certified in time for that.

However, all is not lost!  The creator of the application, Craig Murphy (@CAMURPHY) has posted the .xap file for the application onto his blog which you can find [here](http://www.craigmurphy.com/blog/?p=2324).  If you have a developer account, then you will be able to side load this application onto your phone (I have just done this, and can testify to it working correctly).

If you don't know how to do the side loading, Craig mentions the Application Deployment Tool, which is really simple to use, and you can find steps to how to use it [here](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsphone/develop/ff769512(v=vs.92).aspx).  The only real gotchas are that you also need to have Zune installed, and your phone unlocked, and your handset must be registered, for the deployment to go through correctly.

Big thanks to Craig for creating the application, I am sure that it will come in really useful on the day!
