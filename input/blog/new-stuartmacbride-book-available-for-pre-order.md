Thanks to an email from Amazon, I have just found out that the new Stuart MacBride book is ready for pre-order, so I have just ordered it.

The new book is called “[Birthdays for the Dead](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007344171/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0007344171)”.

If you have never read any Stuart MacBride books, I would roughly recommend that you do.  I picked up his first book, [Cold Granite](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007193149/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0007193149), when I was going through Aberdeen Airport on a business trip, and since then, I have bought and read all his books.

The main series of books are based around Detective Logan McRae, who works for the Grampian Police in Aberdeen.  I have always liked the fact that I can read the book and know exactly where the characters are, and the local dialect used in the conversations is always good for a laugh!  There is definitely a serious tone to the books though, with crimes ranging from murder, to kidnap, to mob related executions, and drugs, so they are not for the faint hearted!

Like two of his other books, [Halfhead](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007349262/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0007349262) and [Sawbones](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1842999575/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=1842999575), this new one takes a break from the Logan MacRae series, so I am really looking forward to reading it and seeing what it is like.  I will post a review once I have read it.
