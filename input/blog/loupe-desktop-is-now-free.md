# ...that's right, Loupe Desktop is now free!


In case you hadn't heard, the [Gibraltar Software](http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/) product [Loupe Desktop](http://www.gibraltarsoftware.com/See/Default.aspx) is now being released completely free!  For more information about the reasons behind this decision, make sure to check out the blog post [here](http://rocksolid.gibraltarsoftware.com/announcements/our-best-log-viewer-is-now-free).  This announcement comes not long after the recent release of Loupe Desktop 3.5.  You can find out about all the new features [here](http://rocksolid.gibraltarsoftware.com/loupe/new-loupe-desktop-features-in-loupe-3-5).

As yet, I haven't had a proper chance to play with Loupe, but it is most certainly on my list of things to check out, and with it now being free, it is even more appealing!
