# First issue created on GitHub

Today I created my first issue on GitHub:

![](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2012/7/3/first-github-issue.png)

This was raised on the [chocolatey.org repository](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/issues/9) when I noticed an issue with pushing a new package when that package already exists.

**UPDATE:** Happy to say that this issue was [fixed](https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org/commit/d65038fd9f9d7507e0592980015e71e8891bb863) on October 6th 2012.

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
