I have just discovered the Windows Live Writer package which is distributed as one of the Windows Live Essentials packages, along with:

- Photo Gallery
- Movie Maker
- Mail
- Messenger
- Family Safety
- Toolbar

You can find more information about it [here](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-writer) and Windows Live Essentials [here](http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other).

So far, I have been very impressed with it, and am using it both on this blog, which uses a customized Community Server blog engine, and at work which has a SharePoint blog, both on which work great.

Live Writer downloads the theme associated with your blog post, including colour, widths, fonts etc, so you get a real time look of how your blog will look before you post it.

There are a number of Plug-inâ€™s that you can use with Live Writer, far too many to talk about here, but so far I am using a Code Highligther Plug-in which automatically converts C# or VB.net code into HTML and a Twitter Plug-in, which automatically creates a tweet when I create a blog post.
