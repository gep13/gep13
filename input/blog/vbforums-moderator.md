As some of you may know, I have been hanging out at [VB Forums](http://www.vbforums.com/) for a while now, mainly posting in the ASP.Net Forum, and trying to help out where I can. I have been a standard member there since 2004, but I have now become a Moderator on the Forums.

I feel very privileged to hold this role, as VB Forums is a thriving community of developers, all across the .Net technologies, as well as other languages and platforms.

I can find me [here](http://www.vbforums.com/member.php?u=53106).
