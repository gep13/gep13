# Bill Wagner - Taking a break from Golf

It is with great pleasure that I can announce that I have been able to confirm Bill Wagner, author of [Effective C#](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Effective-Covers-4-0-Development-ebook/dp/B003BXRNZI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1370544140&sr=8-1&keywords=effective+c%23) and [More Effective C#](http://www.amazon.co.uk/More-Effective-Specific-Development-ebook/dp/B001FA0MAC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1370544140&sr=8-2&keywords=effective+c%23), to do User Group Presentations in both Glasgow and Aberdeen.

I have to send out a huge thank you to Mark Rendle ([@markrendle](https://twitter.com/markrendle)) for the initial introductions, and obviously a special thank to Bill for agreeing to visit these User Groups.  Bill is taking time out of a busy golfing holiday (which I am very jealous of) to present topics on Async and Await Practices in C# 5.
