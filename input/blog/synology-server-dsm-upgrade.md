Yesterday I found out that there was a new version of the DSM (DiskStation Manager) for my [Synology DS410 Server](http://www.synology.com/enu/products/DS410/index.php), so after downloading the correct version (I incorrectly downloaded the DSM for the [DS1511+](http://www.synology.com/enu/products/DS1511+/index.php), if only I could afford one of those!!), I set about installing it.

I have always been a little bit worried about doing one of these upgrades. I am using the Synology Server as the main location for basically all of my files, so if something were to go wrong during the upgrade I would be at a loss for a while until I put everything back together.

On the bright side, Synology are VERY good at what they do, and I am happy to report that the installation of DSM 3.1-1594 went off without any problems!

This update brings a redesign to the following packages to provide an easy-to-use experience:
  
- Download Station 3
- Audio Station 3
- Photo Station
- Surveillance Station
 
In addition, there is a brand new Mail Station 2 package to provide multiple SMTP Servers, and multiple email account fetching. Recently, I have moved away from trying to host my own mail server, as I found it just too much work for little reward, however, I may have to re-think this given this new offering!

The best feature for me though would have to be the “Auto DSM Update”. This will save a lot of hassle and concern, by allowing the Synology Server to maintain itself.

I am still VERY tempted to play with the [Surveillance Station](http://www.synology.com/enu/products/features/live_view.php). I don’t have a network camera just now, but I have just found out that you can use the [DS Cam application](http://forum.synology.com/wiki/index.php/Surveillance_Station_-_Using_DS_cam) on an iPhone/Android enabled phone, so I think the wife's phone phone might be getting a work out soon!!
