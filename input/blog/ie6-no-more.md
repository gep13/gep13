In order to support the growing campaign to [kill off the usage of IE6](http://www.ie6countdown.com/) across the world, I have just enabled the [IE 6 No More plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ie6nomore/) on this blog. From now on, if you access this blog using IE 6, you will be prompted with the following:

![IE6 No More Toolbar](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2011/3/14/image.png)

How about you join me in this campaign?
