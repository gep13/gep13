I have been involved in the Chocolatey project in one way or another for a lot of years, and in that time, I have collected a lot of Chocolatey swag.

It wasn't until I was clearing out a few things, and looking at other collections of swag that I had, that I thought it would be a good idea to collect all of it into one place.

I might get the order of the creation of these wrong, or where they were given out, but I am hoping that [Rob](https://twitter.com/ferventcoder) will be able to help out here to put them in the correct order, and also to provide more details.

## T-Shirts

![Chocolatey Experience](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-choco-experience-small.png)

This was the first official Chocolatey t-shirt which was created as part of the Chocolatey Kickstarter.

![Chocolatey Experience - White](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-choco-experience-white-small.jpeg)

This t-shirt was also available in white (I chose to go for the black version).  A photo of the white version was provided by [Jan Karger](https://twitter.com/punker76).

![Chocolatey Automation](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-choco-auto-small.png)

Following on from the Kickstarter design, this became the default Chocolatey t-shirt for a long period of time.

![Chocolatey.io](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chocoio-small.png)

This was a slight variation on the default t-shirt.

![Chocolatey.io colour](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chocoio-colour-small.png)

I don't think many of these ones were made, but it is one of my favourites.

![Chocolatey Fest Front](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chocofest-front-small.png)

![Chocolatey Fest Back](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chocofest-back-small.png)

This was the official t-shirt of the inaugural Chocolatey Conference, Chocolatey Fest, in 2018.

![Grey Polo Shirt](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-polo-grey-small.png)

![Navy Polo Shirt](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-polo-navy-small.png)

These ones are polo-shirts, which are only available to Chocolatey Employees and Contractors.

![PSH Summit](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-pshsummit-small.png)

This was given out to attendees of PSH Summit in 2019.

![ChefConf](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chefconf-small.png)

This t-shirt was given out to attendees at ChefConf in 2019, both here in the UK, and in the USA.

![AnsibleFest](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-ansiblefest-small.png)

This t-shirt was given out at the AnsibleFest conference in 2019.

![Chocolatey Strawberry Front](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-strawberry-front-small.png)

![Chocolatey Strawberry Back](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-strawberry-back-small.png)

This was a limited edition run, featuring the "Config Management Strawberry Dipped in Chocolatey", created by [Adil](https://twitter.com/adilio).  This was given out in very limited numbers to attendees of both AnsibleFest and Puppetize.  There aren't many of these in the wild, so definitely a collectors item if you have one!

![Puppetize](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-puppetize-small.png)

This was given out to attendees of Puppetize in 2019.

![Arc Reactor Blue](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-arcreactor-blue-small.png)

![Arc Reactor Grey](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-arcreactor-small.png)

![Arc Reactor Black](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-arcreactor-black-small.png)

This is another [Adil](https://twitter.com/adilio) design, and it is available in blue and grey, and it is inspired by the arc reactor from Iron Man.  I believe I am right in saying that the blue and black ones are only available to Employees and Contractors for Chocolatey.

![11th Birthday Colour](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-11th-birthday-colour-small.png)

![11th Birthday White](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-11th-birthday-white-small.png)

These t-shirts were created as part of the 11th Birthday celebrations for Chocolatey. Full praise goes to [Steph](https://twitter.com/st3phhays) for the creation of this design!

## Hoodies

![Hoodie](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/hoodie-small.png)

This was available to some Kickstarter backers, depending on what level you backed the project with.

## Jacket

![Jacket](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/jacket-small.png)

Inspired by the Microsoft MVP Jacket, there is an official Chocolatey Jacket available to Chocolatey Employees and Contractors.  This is an amazing quality jacket!

## Hat

![Hat Front Left](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/hat2-small.png)

This was created by my colleague [Stevie](https://twitter.com/steviecoaster), and I absolutely love it!  These were made in a very small quantity, and you should count yourself very lucky if you have one.  This is my go to hat!

![New Hat Front](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/new-hat-front.png)

![New Hat Rear](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/new-hat-rear.png)

Following on from his original creation, [Stevie](https://twitter.com/steviecoaster) then created another amazing hat! This is my new go to hat!

## Chocolate

![Chocolate](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/chocolate-small.png)

Oh yes, in addition to creating a Package Manager for Windows, we have also created some Chocolate.  This was given out to attendees at Chocolatey Fest in 2018.

## Stickers

![Chocolatey Sticker](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker-small.png)

We have literally given out 1000's of these at various conferences over the years!

![Chocolatey Fest](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker3-small.png)

This sticker was given out to all attendees at Chocolatey inaugural conference Chocolatey Fest, in 2018.

![Chocolatey Golden Ticket](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker2-small.png)

In keeping with the Willy Wonka theme of Chocolatey Fest, the Chocolatey Golden Ticket sticker was created.

![Chocolatey Strawberry Large](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker5-small.png)

This is a reasonably new design created by my colleague [Adil](https://twitter.com/adilio).  It can be found in a couple different sizes.

![11th Birthday](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker-birthday.png)

Similar to the t-shirts there were made for the 11th Birthday celebrations, a limited run of stickers were created.

As a sponsor of the WinOps events, Chocolatey has appeared on their lanyards at least a couple of times.

## Unofficial - but still awesome

### T-Shirts

Created by [Manfred Wallner](https://twitter.com/schusterfredl) (a Chocolatey Community Member), this is a t-shirt showing the combination of Chocolatey and Boxstarter, which was the topic of his talk at the WinOps Conference.

### Stickers

[Manfred](https://twitter.com/schusterfredl) also took the time to create a sticker version of the t-shirt design that he created.

This was created by [Stevie](https://twitter.com/steviecoaster) and [Adil](https://twitter.com/adilio) for the Founder of Chocolatey, [Rob Reynolds](https://twitter.com/ferventcoder).

### Posters

![Choco Poster](https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/poster.png)

Inspired by some posters that I saw [Patrik Svensson](https://twitter.com/firstdrafthell) have made, I reached out to [Bartek](https://twitter.com/brtkdotse) who [created them](https://dekalfabriken.se/), and had him make one for Chocolatey. This poster takes pride of place on the wall in my office!
