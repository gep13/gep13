I have just found out about the existence of a group called techmeetup in Aberdeen:

[http://techmeetup.co.uk/](http://techmeetup.co.uk/)

They meet every month in the Meston Building at Aberdeen University, and discuss a range of different topics. I am going to attend their next meeting.

You can find them on twitter with [@techmeetup](http://twitter.com/techmeetup).
