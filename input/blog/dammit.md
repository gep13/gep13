The one day that I don't take an umbrella with me to work, and it starting pissing it down just as it is time to go home!! Got absolutely soaked on the way home, it's only about a 15 min walk, 10 blocks, but that is a long time when you are getting soaked!!

Note to self, remember to take umbrella with me to work!!!
