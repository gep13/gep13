As most of you will know, I have been a long time fan of the author Stuart MacBride. As shown [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/stuart-macbride-broken-skin), [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/stuart-macbride-flesh-house) and [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/new-stuartmacbride-book-available-for-pre-order).

After I got the new book, [Birthdays for the Dead](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0007344171/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0007344171), delivered, I found out that Stuart was going to be doing a book signing at the local WHSmith in Aberdeen. Book in hand, I decided that I would go along to the book signing. (I have to admit that I checked first in order to make sure that bringing a book that I had already purchased into the book store, but I was told that this would be ok, but I took the receipt just to be on the safe side). Although not ideal for me, I am happy to report that the queue for getting the book signed was massive. I knew that Stuart was a popular author in the North East, but to get such a turn out was great to see. Congratulations!

With some time to kill while I was in the queue, I started to read the book, and I have to say, so far so good. I will keep you posted on how it goes.

For those interested, here is the result of waiting in the queue:
