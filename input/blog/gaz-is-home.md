Flew into Aberdeen today, so good to be home!!

Had a bit of a panic at London as I thought I wasn't going to make the transfer, literally had to run from Terminal 4 to Terminal 5. I made it though, which was the main thing!!

There was a woman throwing up in the seat behind me coming into London, needless to say I was glad to get off the plane.

Was met at the airport by Lynn, and to my surprise, Steve and Louie. Was great to see everyone!

Oh, and when I got to Aberdeen, guess what....

...it was raining.
