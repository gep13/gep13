Went to go and see the new Angelina Jolie film [Wanted](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493464/) this afternoon.

Turns out that it is actually quite a good movie!!!

As long as you are willing to over look a few key things, such as the ability to [bend bullets](http://io9.com/5018516/could-you-shoot-bendy-bullets-just-like-in-wanted), and the [ability to shoot the wings off a fly](http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080627013145AAjjb1F&amp;show=7) then you should enjoy the film. If on the other hand, you don't like the completely infeasible, then I would say stay away.
