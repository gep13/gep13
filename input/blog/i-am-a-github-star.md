I am very happy to announce that yesterday I got an email confirming that I had been accepted as a [GitHub Star](https://stars.github.com/).

For those of you who don't know, the GitHub Star Award is a program to...

> Recognize those who go above and beyond. Lift up the people who inspire and educate your communities with the GitHub Stars program

I knew that I had been nominated for the award since I was asked to provide some examples of contributions that I have made in the last year, but I was thrilled to find out that I had been accepted.  I am honoured to think that folks out there thought that I was worthy of this award, and I would like to thank them for nominating me!
