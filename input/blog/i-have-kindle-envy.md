Title: I have Kindle envy…

Back in February, I bought myself a [Kindle](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B002LVUWFE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B002LVUWFE) and I blogged about it [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=93). I have been very happy with it, and through some cracking deals at the likes of [O’Reilly](http://oreilly.com/) and [Manning Publications](http://www.manning.com/) I now have an extensive set of technical books on the Kindle. Now all I need is time to read them all ![Smile](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-smile1.png).

So, what is the problem?

Well, a colleague at work has just bought the new shiny [Kindle](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0051QVF7A/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=B0051QVF7A), pictured to the left, and I am jealous ![Sad smile](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/wlEmoticon-sadsmile1.png). It is a cracking piece of kit. In terms of screen real estate, it is exactly the same as the Kindle that I have, but the lack of the physical keyboard and smaller bevel around the outside, means that it is a much smaller device, and also lighter.

I thought that the lack of physical keyboard would bother me, but realistically, the only time that I use the keyboard is to enter the password to unlock the device, and that is it. Although a little bit of a pain to navigate an on-screen keyboard with the directional pad, it isn’t the end of the world.

So now the next question, do I flog my Kindle on eBay and get a new one? Or do I wait and see when the Kindle Touch will land in the UK? Do I even need touch screen for the Kindle? Questions, Questions Questions!

Anyone want an older model Kindle?
