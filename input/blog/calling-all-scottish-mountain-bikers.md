A friend of mine has started a new website dedicated to Mountain Biking in Scotland.  The site is called MTB Trails, and you can find it [here](http://www.mtbtrails.info/).  Full information about what the site is for, and it’s objectives can be found [here](http://www.mtbtrails.info/About.aspx).

If you are at all interested in Mountain Biking, I would highly recommend that you check it out!
