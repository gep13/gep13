Ok, let me just state that I have been a great man of the X Files, ever since it came out, and I have watched every episode, watched the film, and read the books, so needless to say, I was really looking forward to this new [film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443701/).

Having watched the trailer for the movie, and seen Billy Connolly on his knees with what looks like the “Black Oil” coming out his eyes, I thought the long running story line of alien gunk was going to be continued in this movie....

...how wrong could I be. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good, but it wasn't like the X Files of old, and if anything, it was like an extended episode, not a film.

Also, it just wasn’t right to see Mulder and Scully getting it on!
