Lynn and I met up with folks and my sister and her boyfriend and his son for a meal this afternoon at the Mill of Mundurno and it was really nice!!!

The food was really nice, and the place looks like it has just been done up, so I would definitely recommend it!!

Couldn't decide what I was going to have, but ended up choosing the Steak Pie (substituting the Mash and Peas for Chips and Beans) and it was lovely. For dessert you were able to choose a small portion of three different desserts, so thought I would go for that. Made two very good choices, the Belgian Waffles and the Cheesecake, but the bitter chocolate pudding definitely wasn't to my taste.
