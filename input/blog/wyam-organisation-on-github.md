# I am now a member of the Wyam Organisation on GitHub

Today, [Dave](https://github.com/daveaglick) made me a member of the Wyam Organisation on GitHub.

I have been following the [Wyam](http://wyam.io/) project with interest for a while now, and this culminated in me creating a Wyam Addin for Cake, so that you can orchestrate Wyam from within your Cake script.  It was decided that this Addin should live within the Wyam organisation, rather than a separate entity, which makes perfect sense.  To that end, I have been added to the team to help with the upkeep of that part of the project.

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
