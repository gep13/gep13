# Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group GitHub Organisation

Today I created a [GitHub Organisation](https://github.com/adnuguk) to support the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group.

Initially, this will house only the source code for the [Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group Website](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/), however, it may grow to accommodate other things as well.

**NOTE:** This is a retrospective blog post after GitHub announced a range of [new features](https://github.com/blog/2256-a-whole-new-github-universe-announcing-new-tools-forums-and-features) including the option to see a history of your contributions.
