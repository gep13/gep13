As per my earlier [blog post](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/progressive-net-tutorials-a-review-skillsmatter-prognet11), this morning I attended the “[Solving the Packaging Puzzle](http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/open-source-dot-net/patterns-and-practices-of-package-management)” featuring Ian Cooper ([@ICooper](https://twitter.com/#!/icooper)) and Sebastian Lambla ([@serialseb](https://twitter.com/#!/serialseb)).

This talk was split into two parts.

The first was the “theory” behind Packages and this was handled by Ian. This included a description of what a “package” is and how we can write our code in such a way as to lend itself for easier package creation.

The second part of the talk was handled by Sebastian, with a “real world” demo of creating a Web Site (using [OpenRasta](http://openrasta.org/)) adding functionality, splitting this functionality into a separate project, packaging the re-usable code and including it in the original Web Site Project. All of this was handled using [OpenWrap](http://www.openwrap.org/).

A lot of the concepts that were described in the first part of the session were not news to me, but they are also not something that I have fully utilised. This is mainly because of my lack of full understanding of how everything pieces together. Ian went into great detail on things like:

- Modular Decomposability
- Modular Composability
- Modular Continuity
- Modular Protection
- Direct Mapping
- Few Interfaces
- Small Interfaces
- SOLID code principles

And how these can be used to ensure that the code base is constructed property.

These are all topics that I have heard about, but never fully put into practice. If nothing else, this morning talk has highlighted that I “need” to read up on these topics. Ian has recommended two books:

[Object-Oriented Software Construction](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0136291554/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0136291554)

and

[Agile Principles, Patterns, and Practices in C#](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0131857258/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=www6thprimeco-21&linkCode=as2&camp=1634&creative=19450&creativeASIN=0131857258)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=&l=as2&o=2&a=0131857258)

Which I am going to have to add to my growing list of books that I have to read.

I got a lot out of the “refactoring” that Sebastian showed in his demonstration of how you can put all the theory into practice. And although the demonstration didn’t go as “smoothly” as I think Sebastian would have liked, for me, it really did hammer the point home.

I have never used OpenWrap, only Nuget. I would be interested to hear from anyone who has used both. Likes? Disklikes? etc.

All in all, a very good start to the Progressive .Net Tutorials, and I am looking forward to the remaining five sessions.
