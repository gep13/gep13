# session submission has been accepted for DDD North


I am very happy to announce that the [Caliburn.Micro](http://caliburnmicro.codeplex.com/) session that I submitted for [DDD North](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/north2) has been accepted!  The abstract for this session was:


# Getting Started with Caliburn.Micro and Windows Phone 7




<blockquote>Getting started with the Windows Phone 7 Development Platform is relatively simple, however, using a Framework like Caliburn.Micro takes away some of the more mundane tasks, and allows you to focus on what you are trying to achieve.  In this session we will start with a blank Windows Phone 7 project, and start to create our first Windows Phone 7 application using features such as:

> 
> 
	
>   * ActionMessages
> 
	
>   * Action Conventions
> 
	
>   * Binding Conventions
> 
	
>   * Navigation Service
> 
	
>   * The Bootstrapper
> 
	
>   * The IPhoneService
> 
	
>   * Tombstoning
> 
	
>   * Lauchers and Choosers
> 
	
>   * The IWindowManager
> 

</blockquote>


This is a new talk for me, and I am very much looking forward to doing it.  I am currently using Caliburn.Micro in the two Windows Phone 7 applications that I am involved with, and I really think that it is a great framework to build on.
