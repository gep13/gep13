Today, me and Lynn went to see the new Will Smith film, [Hancock](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0448157/). For a while, it was difficult to see where this film was going, on one hand you had a reluctant hero in the form of Will Smith, and a seemingly normal family who takes pity on him. However, there is more to the normal family than meets the eye.

 

I won't say too much more, in case anyone hasn't seen it, but I get the impression that the writers were trying a bit to hard to fit the whole story into the time allotted though! It was worth a watch, but don't think I will be buying it on DVD.
