Thanks again to everyone who turned up to the first Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group meeting last night, it was great to see so many people there.

As promised, I have uploaded the screenshots of what we are hoping the new User Group website will look like, you can find them here:

http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/News/Website-Branding.aspx

EDIT: Due to changes in the Aberdeen Developers site, the News section no longer exists.

It would be great to hear some feedback on what you think about the design, and what you think we should be putting onto the website.  Feel free to use the forums on the site to provide feedback:

EDIT: Due to changes in the Aberdeen Developers site, the Forums no longer exist.

Or drop us an email here:

It would also be good to get some direct feedback what how you think the first presentation went.  We have created a survey here:

EDIT: Due to changes in the Aberdeen Developers site, the survey no longer exists.

On another note, during the presentation, I was hoping to be able to show you the benefits of using some of the features that exist within the higher end of Visual Studio (namely Visual Studio Ultimate), but I wasn’t able to get the files in time for the presentation.  It is with much thanks to Norman Noble that I am now able to bring you these files:



	
  * [Dependency Graph](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Uploads/Meetings/DependencyGraph.zip)

	
  * [Sequence Diagram](http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/Uploads/Meetings/SequenceDiagram.zip)


If you load these files into Visual Studio, you should see something that resembles the following:

When taking over an existing code base, or trying to create some documentation, these tools can be a life saver.  The only down side is that you need the Ultimate Edition of Visual Studio to create them, but once they are created, you can open them in any version of Visual Studio 2010.
For information on how these diagrams can be created, have a look here:

Thanks again to Norman for creating these files for me!!
