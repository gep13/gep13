With reference to my [list of events here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=571), I am happy to say that today I finished getting everything booked for attending the UK Tech Days, in London in February.

 

Microsoft are putting on two events:

 

  
  * [Windows Azure Bootcamp – 3rd February 2012](http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(london).aspx)
   
  * [Windows Phone Camp – 4th February 2012](http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(london).aspx)
 

**NOTE: If you can’t make the London events, the events are being repeated in Bristol the following week. Information [here](http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-azure-bootcamp-(bristol).aspx) and [here](http://uktechdays.cloudapp.net/upcoming-events/windows-phone-camp-(bristol).aspx).**

 

Now that the hassle of getting the flights etc. booked has passed, I am very much looking forward to both of these events!

 

With the exception of a review that I did for a devFusion article, which made use of Windows Azure, I haven’t done anything with it. I am very interested to learn _exactly _what it is, how and where it can be used, and also how easily it can be integrated into existing applications. For instance, I recently saw this new [WordPress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/windows-azure-storage/) from Microsoft. This type of integration is very interesting, and I am curious to see how this could work elsewhere.

 

I have been “dabbling” with Windows Phone 7 for a while now, but I haven’t given it the attention that it needs to learn it properly, and I am hoping that the Windows Phone Bootcamp will be the kick-start that is required. After all, I have the developer account ready and waiting, just no applications to push onto the Marketplace. In addition, I will also get the opportunity to finally meet Pete Vickers ([@petevick](https://twitter.com/#!/petevick)) from [AppaMundi](http://appamundi.com/) in person. I have “known” Pete for a while now as he hangs out on the Mobile Development Forums over at [VBForums](http://www.vbforums.com/forumdisplay.php?f=70), and it will be great to catch up at the event.

 

If you are thinking about attending these events I would strongly encourage you to get registered as soon as possible as some of them have gone to the waiting list stage and you may miss out.

 

If you are not able to make it, keep an eye on this blog as I intend to do posts over the course of the weekend, so hopefully I can keep you up to date with what I learn while I am there.
