I have just secured my place at the upcoming DDD Scotland Event, which is taking place at the Glasgow Caledonian University on Saturday, 7th May 2011. If you haven’t already done so, you can register for the event [here](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/Register.aspx).

 

There were some VERY interesting sessions proposed for the day long activities (5 tracks, with 5 sessions in each), which you can see [here](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/ProposedSessions.aspx), but the final list of chosen sessions can be found [here](http://scottishdevelopers.com/2011/03/14/ddd-scotland-2011-agenda/). I have been reliably informed by @argibson that this list will make it onto the main [DDD Scotland site](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/scotland2011/Default.aspx) once the final confirmations have been received from the speakers. The hard part now is to decide what sessions I want to attend!!

     

Hot on the heels of [DDD9](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=28), I am very much looking forward to attending DDD Scotland, and I would highly recommend everyone to attend.

 

In addition to the 5 main tracks, there are rumours circulating about a 6th, “alternative”, track in the planning stages, which I am very interested to hear more about.

 

Keep up the good work guys!!
