As some of you will know, I have a lifetime subscription to the following site:

[http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/](http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/)

They have recently released to new video series.

[Windows Phone 7 Development for Absolute Beginners](http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/content/series/Windows_Phone_7_Development_for_Absolute_Beginners.aspx)

and

[Silverlight 4.0 – Level 1](http://www.learnvisualstudio.net/content/series/Silverlight_4_0_Level_1.aspx)

I have now watched the first 6 videos in the WP7 series, and as usual, the quality of the videos are very good.  Bob Tabor is using a new format for his videos (at least a new format for me), in which he actually presents to the camera, as well as the usual video view of his Visual Studio instance.

The video series is very much aimed at the complete beginner, and begins gently with an introduction to installing the Windows Phone 7 tools, as well as getting started with the IDE, and Windows Phone Emulator.

If you haven’t already, I would highly recommend that you take a look at LVS.Net, they have a huge selection of videos ranging in topic and length.
