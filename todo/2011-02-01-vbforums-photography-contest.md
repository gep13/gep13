I have just entered my first VBForums Photography contest. This is the seventh of these events, but this is the first time that I have felt that I have some decent enough photos that I could enter into it. Details of the contest can be found [here](http://www.vbforums.com/announcement.php?f=25&a=49).

 

Here are my entries:

I would welcome any feedback on these pictures, although bear in mind, I am only getting started with photography, and I know I have a lot to learn.
