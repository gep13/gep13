The following is a list of the applications that I currently have installed on my HTC HD7 running Windows Phone 7. This is not intended to be a comprehensive list of “essential” Windows Phone 7 Applications, but rather a list that I will use for my own purposes (as a gentle reminder of what I have installed in case something ever goes wrong) and which will likely change over time as more applications are found.

 

Feel free to let me know about any apps that you have that you think that I would benefit from, I always like to hear about new things!

 

_NOTE: If you are interested in how I got the URL’s for the applications listed here, take a look at this blog post _[_here_](http://www.addictivetips.com/mobile/find-id-of-windows-phone-7-app-and-create-direct-zune-marketplace-link/)_._

 

**__MarketPlace Applications__**

 

[…i’m a wp7!](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=16b4f331-e05b-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) – I have to admit, I haven’t done much with this particular app yet, but it does show a lot of promise. Perhaps, as more people start using it, it will become more useful.

 

[Adobe Reader](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=bc4f319a-9a9a-df11-a490-00237de2db9e) – Not an application that I use a lot, but very handy when trying to read the odd PDF on the phone

 

[Allrecipes](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=23828a51-5391-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) – I am a terrible cook, but at least this will help me get all the ingredients needed for throwing something together.

 

[Amazon Kindle](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=48195fb4-ee0e-e011-9264-00237de2db9e) – Thanks to Amazon’s WhisperSync technology picking up your book from where you left off is just a joy

 

[Another Level](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=28822e51-cf15-440c-b97a-2c1671986fa4) – A very nicely put together app, that is VERY useful!

 

[BabelCam](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=576327f5-785c-4997-bc01-dc9fe4423f88) – Again, another app that I haven’t had to use yet, but I really like the idea of it.

 

[Bing Get Me There](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=744d9d43-ee65-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8) – I used this on my last trip to London, and it is an absolute must!

 

[British Airways](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=2f9d08aa-b17b-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) – This is an application that I use a lot, mainly because I don’t fly BA all the time, but it is a very nice sample application of what can be achieved.

 

[Cocktail Flow](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=ddd1ad08-d9d5-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) – Like the [British Airways](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=2f9d08aa-b17b-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) application, this is one I use as a reference application more than anything else

 

[Currency](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=dc5f12fa-b49d-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) – Just one of those apps that you should have installed.

 

[Dictionary.com](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=03ad3d9b-c79d-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) – Just one of those apps that you should have installed.

 

[Dude, WIMU](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=b13f4051-2a57-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) – When the Nodo update was running late, this application was very handy for checking on the status of the update. Let’s hope Mango isn’t going to be the same

 

[eBay](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=92d3a3a3-66d9-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) – I don’t do a lot of eBay shopping, but when I do, I like to keep an eye on my bids, and this helps perfectly with this.

 

[Facebook](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=82a23635-5bd9-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) – Typically I use the built in OS functionality for talking to Facebook, but there are some things that it can’t do, so being able to fall back to the full application is always handy.

 

[Flickr](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=2e49fb07-592b-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) – When nice application for looking at your photostream and your friends.

 

[Gifts](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=cfd5a18e-1df8-df11-9264-00237de2db9e) – With the run up to Christmas and birthdays, this provides the ability to track what presents you have bought and ideas for others.

 

[gMaps](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=7b8bedd5-4368-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8) – Normally I default to the built in Maps application, however there have been times I have used this, for instance, when trying to get traffic updates.

 

[Groupon](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=47878950-105f-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8) – Even though they are in trouble just now with the OFT, a handy app to have on the phone.

 

[GuestList](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=b9cd6b7b-1be1-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) – I have been playing with this app in order to track the attendees at the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group meetings. It doesn’t quite do everything that I want, so may be replaced with another Eventbrite application.

 

[handyscan](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=5b5aa6e8-1af3-df11-9264-00237de2db9e) – Does exactly what it says on the tin!

 

[IMDB](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=ff971299-eed8-df11-a844-00237de2db9e) – Amazing application, nothing else to say.

 

[Jingle Balls](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=f113744f-d700-e011-9264-00237de2db9e) – A very simple, yet addictive little application. Perfect for the holiday season.

 

[IN+ Networking](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=518ccdb1-c360-4cf0-a0f6-89b2890bda6e) – The LinkedIn integration on the WP7 isn’t perfect, and this fills the void.

 

[LastPass](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=9b86eadc-16e8-df11-9264-00237de2db9e) – I am currently “trialling” LastPass across my multiple computers, and having it on the phone is a bonus, also there are some websites that it just flat out doesn’t work with.

 

[Love Clean Streets](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=21462e9b-4fe8-df11-9264-00237de2db9e) – I really like the idea of this application although I have not yet had the occasion to use it.

 

[MY LOVEFiLM MOBILE](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=c8366df9-1127-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) – Very handy to be able to add items to our LoveFilm lists without having to log into the computer.

 

[My Trips](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=76ed9db6-d201-e011-9264-00237de2db9e) – I have been using TripIt for a while now, and this application does an incredible job of bringing down all the information directly to your phone.

[Phonealytics](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=21baf298-210a-4fe1-9a89-6314ae62151f) – A very good interface into your Google Analytics data.

 

[Pocket C#](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=2f840483-0a54-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) – A cracking example of what can be achieved by an application running on Windows Phone 7

 

[rowi](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=304c9bfd-9b65-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8) – This is now my default Twitter client (over took [BirdSong](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=ac61a1bc-9325-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) a while back). It is very quick at bringing down the updates to your phone.

 

[Shazam](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=2f8d5271-2b81-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8) – I have yet to get this to actually provide me the name of the song that I am listening to, but I am holding out hope.

[SkyMap](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=dd2dbb0f-7c24-e011-854c-00237de2db9e) – Love it! Not free, but lots of information.

 

[SuperTimer](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=d54df30e-f4b7-4450-b73c-37386b469195) – Another app that does exactly what it says on the tin!

[appa mundi tasks](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=55fcf880-6b03-e011-9264-00237de2db9e) – Due to the fact that Tasks synchronisation with Exchange is missing in the built in Windows Phone 7 OS, this application is pretty much mandatory.

[TFS Phone Explorer](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=f82cfdd2-0763-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8) – A very nice idea. Unfortunately, our TFS at work is not publically accessible, so haven’t been able to put it through its paces.

 

[TouchDevelop](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&id=fe08ccec-a360-e011-81d2-78e7d1fa76f8) – Has to be seen to be believed!
