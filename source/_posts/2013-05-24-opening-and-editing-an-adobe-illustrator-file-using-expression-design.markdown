# Open and edit a .ai file using Expression Design


The other week, I needed to edit the original source files for the Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group in order to change the size of the png's that I use for various things (like avatar's, etc).  Unfortunately, these were created using Adobe Illustrator, which I don't have access to.  I had a hunt around, but I couldn't find a way to do it.  Enter Twitter...

The ever knowledgeable Scott Lovegrove ([@scottisafool](https://twitter.com/scottisafool)), made a great suggestion of using Expression Design to open and edit the files.  I had thought that Expression Design was only part of the Expression Studio, which I also don't have, but...


# Expression Design is free!


Although it used to only be part of the Expression Studio, Express Design is now actually free!  You can download it from [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36180).


# Opening and Editing the file


This couldn't be simpler!  Open up Expression Design, and open the file.  Once open, you will have the option to Export the image:

On the next window, you will then be able to choose the output format, and also the size of the resulting image:

Simples!  Thanks again Scott!
