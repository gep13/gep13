I have just seen on Twitter via [@Plip](http://www.twitter.com/#!/Plip) that [Scott Guthrie](http://www.weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/) (aka [@scottgu](http://www.twitter.com/#!/scottgu)) will be coming to London on the 6th June 2011. Full details of the event can be found here:

I went to the [Glasgow Guathan](http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/guglas/) back in March 2010 just after Visual Studio 2010 and ASP.Net 4.0 had been released and I have to say that it was a very good event!! An entire day of learning from, quite literally, the guy who helped build ASP.Net, with the ability to ask questions as well, is just amazing!

 

Unfortunately, I don’t think I will be able to make it down to this event this time, but I would highly recommend that you attend if you can.
