Had my birthday night out tonight, and I have to say, I had a great time.

 

I was actually debating about not going out because of the weather, it had been snowing since Friday, and a couple of my mates had decided that they were not going to make the trip out from Peterhead in case they got stuck. Decided we should just go, and very glad we did....

 

Finally met up with everyone at Slain's Castle (major problem with the taxi that we had booked, just got the bus instead) where we had an area reserved. Was able to catch up with a lot of people that I hadn't seen since I got back, so that was really good. I think everyone had a good time, at least I hope so.

 

I had also booked us on the guest list at Tiger Tiger, but we decided that it would be easier to get home at 1 rather than trying to get home once the club's kicked out. So it was in past the pie shop for a steak pie and then into the taxi queue. Again, not much luck with the taxi's, ended up getting the number 17X bus home.

 

Great night!!
