Having logged into my Blog this morning, I was informed that a new release of WordPress was available; Version 3.3.1.

Upon checking what was included in this [release](http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/wordpress-3-3-1/), it was clear that this was something that I should get installed pretty much straight away, and this is exactly what I did.

 

With the Database and Files backed up, I hit the Update button, and once again I am happy to say that everything “just worked”. It is good to see that the WordPress Developers are adding a “bit of fun” into the update process:

Since this update addresses a Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability, I would highly recommend that everyone using WordPress update their sites immediately.
