I have been giving a lot of thought about the development software packages that I use on a daily basis (both at work and at home), and which ones, if any, I should change out. For example, I have been hearing a lot of good things about TeamCity (for the purposes of Continuous Integration) and CodeRush/ReSharper as IDE Productivity Tools.

 

As a result, I am looking to get some opinions from some fellow developers about what they are using. 

 

What I currently use is the following:

 

  
  * Development Environment – Visual Studio 2010
   
  * Source Control – TFS
   
  * Continuous Integration – TFS
   
  * Work Item Management – TFS
   
  * Unit Testing – MSTest
   
  * Integration Testing – Nothing at the minute ![Sad smile](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/517cd9ae4196_12CEC/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png)
   
  * IDE Productivity Tools – StyleCop, Code Analysis
   
  * Various Visual Studio 2010 [Extensions](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=3)
 

So basically, what I am hoping for is feedback on what you use, either at home or at work, and what you like about the packages that you use. Am I missing anything critical? Are there any software packages for development purposes that you are using, that you now simply couldn’t live without?

 

All opinions are welcome!
