I am very jealous!!! My sister and her partner have just got a new dog, a German Shepherd. Her name is Harlo, and she is 7 weeks old. You can see some pictures of her below:

I have always wanted a German Shepherd, ever since I was little, so you better believe I will be offering to dog-sit.

We went round to visit her tonight, and she is very cute!!!

UPDATE: My sister and her partner actually now have a second dog.  She is called Kiwi, and she is a Black Labrador.  You can see some photos of her below:
