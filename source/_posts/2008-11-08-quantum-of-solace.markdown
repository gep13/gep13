Went to see the new Bond Film, [Quantum of Solace](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0830515/), this morning. I was down in Glasgow with Lynn, and after not being able to go on the Tour that I wanted to, decided to go to the cinema instead. And I am glad that I did!! I really enjoyed the film!!

 

The action sequences, and the fight scenes were amazing. I did think that the film jumped around a little bit, but apart from that, a very good film.

 

I am having to rethink the order of my “Best James Bond of All Time”. Daniel Craig has still got a lot to prove, but he is working his way up the list.
