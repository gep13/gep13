This blog post is one of a series of blogs on Visual Studio Addins that I use. To go back to the series index page, click [here](http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/?p=146).

Personally, I think this Addin has a couple of little gems in it, that I quite simply wouldn’t work without anymore, you can download it here:

 

[http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerCommands)

 

All features are enabled by deafult, but you can enable/disable them to suit your needs under Tools | Options | PowerCommands.

 

This Addin includes things like:

 

  
  * Insert Guid Attribute 
   
  * Collapse Projects 
   
  * Edit Project File 
   
  * Remove and Sort Usings
 

And many more.
