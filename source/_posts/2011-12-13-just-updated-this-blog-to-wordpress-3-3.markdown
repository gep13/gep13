Thanks to a tweet from Richard Hay ([@WinObs](https://twitter.com/#!/WinObs)), I have just updated this WordPress blog to WordPress 3.3.  As always the installation was painless, and the new look and feel is very nice!  Might take a bit of getting used to, but in a good way.

If you are interested in the new features that WordPress 3.3 has to offer, you can check them out in the video below.  I am particularly impressed with the new drag and drop features for adding media to your blog, and the changes to the menus make perfect sense and are a great addition!
