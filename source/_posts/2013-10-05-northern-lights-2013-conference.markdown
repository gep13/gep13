# Get your tickets now!


I wanted to let you know about an upcoming event in Aberdeen that I have been helping to arrange. It is taking place on Friday 18th October 2013.  The event in question is the Northern Lights 2013 Conference.  The website for the conference can be found here:

The event is in its third year, and this year the theme is tools.  Both the tools that we use, and the tools we build.  There is a wide range of speakers available, including:

  * [Hadi Hariri](http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/hadi-hariri.html)

	
  * [Kendall Miller](http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/kendall-miller.html)

	
  * [Sarah Drummond](http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/24/sarah-drummond.html)

	
  * [Kate Stone](http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/kate-stone.html)

	
  * [Maria Gutierrez](http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/10/02/maria-gutierrez.html)

	
  * [Niall Merrigan](http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/niall-merrigan.html)

	
  * [Glenn Hendrickson](http://northernlightsconf.co.uk/speakers/2013/09/23/glenn-henriksen.html)


Who are offering up an exciting line up of talks.

In addition, there will be two open spaces at the conference, where attendees will have an opportunity to suggest a topic for an interactive conversation with other attendees and speakers.  If you haven’t been to an open space before, they are fantastic.  It is a perfect opportunity to interact with other like mind people about a topic that you are interested in.  The best way to get something out of this is to suggest a topic that you are especially interested in, and hopefully other people will get involved as well.

Tickets are £15 for the day, which includes coffee and lunch for regular attendees, and Students tickets to the talks are free, plus you can buy a lunch ticket for £5.

We hope to see you there.  If you have any questions about the event, then please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me.

If you know anyone else who would be interested in attending this event, I would really appreciate it if you could forward on this email.
