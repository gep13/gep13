I am happy to inform you that I have been able to confirm another meeting on the 23rd September. Colin Mackay, of Scottish Developers will be doing a talk on SQL Injection, and how to prevent it. Full details of the event can be found here:

I am also currently working on getting another meeting lined up for October/November. Still need to confirm a few details, so I won’t say too much just yet, but it is likely to be an ASP.Net talk. If there is something specific in this area that you would like to hear a talk on, then let me know, and I will see what I can do.
