Last night was the Matrikon Christmas Party, and it was at the Ardoe House Hotel. We had 7 tables, and there were a number of other companies there as well, so it was a good atmosphere.

I thought the meal was very good, but I heard some people that they didn't like it very much, “turkey was too dry”, “dessert was disgusting”, etc., but I really liked it.

Wes took the role of Paparazzi for the evening, so I am hoping that he has got some good shots. I will try and get the photos from him and put them up on the website.

The night ended with the obligatory rendition was Runrig's Loch Lomond, which was a lot of fun, and then it was home to bed.

The photos from the night can be seen here:
