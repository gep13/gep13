&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-vscode/issues/432"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#432&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ability to download bootstrappers for all supported runners&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-vscode/issues/429"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#429&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 'Add [tool|addin] from nuget' should save the Cake script if it's already open.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-vscode/issues/376"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#376&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Debug should use Cake.Tool instead of Cake.CoreCLR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-vscode/pull/339"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#339&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Bump request from 2.88.0 to 2.88.2&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Stream Number 100</title>
		<updated>2020-09-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;On tonights stream, which was stream 100 (quite a milestone) I was joined by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mkevenaar"&gt;Maurice Kevenaar&lt;/a&gt;, who was showing us how to install/setup/use his new chocolatey-diff tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-diff"&gt;https://github.com/chocolatey-community/chocolatey-diff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a PowerShell module, which makes it possible to quickly identify the differences between two package versions for a Chocolatey Package. This is especially useful for moderators who are reviewing packages in the moderation queue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We showed how this can be used on both Windows and Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were some issues with Twitch this evening which is a little unfortunate, but we made the most of it.  Maurice and I were able to continue chatting even though the connection to Twitch was failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="recording"&gt;Recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the recording of the stream here:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Chocolatey in the Organisation Video Series</title>
		<updated>2020-08-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h2 id="video-series"&gt;Video Series&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite often get asked questions around how to set up Chocolatey in the context of an Organisation, i.e. How do I create my own repository?  How can I internalize packages into my own feed?  How can I install Chocolatey offline?  And various others over the years.  A lot of this is already documented on the Chocolatey website, however, it can't always be the easiest to find, something that we are working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help alleviate some of this, I decided to create a series of videos, where I would start with literally nothing installed, only the base operating system, and from there, start to create a collection of servers, all with the aim of setting up a best practices deployment of Chocolatey within an Organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This series of videos now exists as a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL84yg23i9GBjc1UBm8llOk_miWVqWk7kl"&gt;public playlist on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and I have also captured the details of the series in the remainder of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please reach out if you have any questions, or if there are areas that haven't been covered in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="overview"&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of videos which is going to walk through setting up Chocolatey for usage within an Organisation.  This is based on the [documentation]https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-setup-offline-installation) on chocolatey.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This introductory video talks through what we are going to be doing in this series, and setting the scene for how things are going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YDmMB83qV5I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id="prepare-for-internal-use"&gt;Prepare for internal use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at the initial setup/download of all the components necessary to get Chocolatey up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The details of what was carried out in this video can be found in the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-setup-offline-installation#exercise-0-prepare-for-internal-use"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; on chocolatey.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To summarise, we installed Chocolatey on our workstation machine, and used Chocolatey Package Internalizer to download and internalize some packages that we will use in later parts of the Organisational setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zh_0eNSNBd0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id="internalize-and-install-bginfo"&gt;Internalize and install bginfo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at internalizing and installing the bginfo utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, as this video series expands and has multiple machines being used, being able to quickly identify which machine is which, based on the information displayed on the desktop will be useful.  To get this internalized, after a small hiccup, we used the Chocolatey for Business feature called Package Internalizer, which gave us a package that can be installed completely offline, without the need to reach out to the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2CA6HCmEPRY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id="install-chocolatey-without-network-access"&gt;Install Chocolatey without network access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at how you can install Chocolatey on a machine that doesn't have an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-setup-offline-installation#exercise-1-optional-set-up-chocolatey-installation-on-a-machine-without-network-access"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; on chocolatey.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The machine in question is the one which is going to be our Nexus Repository Server.  We start by copying the setup files from our workstation machine, and then edit the offline installation script to perform the installation fully offline.  We ensure that this is the case by disabling the network card on the machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="install-and-configure-nexus"&gt;Install and configure Nexus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at installing and configuring a Nexus Repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start by downloading the nexus-repository package, and performing the installation.  Once that is done, we set up two nuget feeds (test-repository and prod-repository) which will be used later within our other configuration.  We also set up the NuGet Authentication Realm, and add the sources to our Chocolatey configuration, to make sure that everything is working as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I mention &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UehkG1VHtz0"&gt;another video&lt;/a&gt; where I set up Nexus as a caching repository (using a proxy feed) for chocolatey.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k7RX3r3dvz8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id="push-packages-to-nexus-repository"&gt;Push packages to Nexus Repository&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we looked at moving all the nupkg's which we had in a local source (i.e. c:/choco-setup/packages) into our newly created Nexus Repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This required a little bit of setup in terms of opening the required firewall port, and also setting up our API Key within Chocolatey, but with that done, we were able to push all packages to both the Test, and Production Repositories within Nexus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1tyD6Kgh6VQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id="create-a-package-for-chocolatey-license"&gt;Create a package for Chocolatey license&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at creating a Chocolatey Package for the Chocolatey License file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In previous videos, we used the local Chocolatey installation script to copy the Chocolatey License file to the correct location.  By using a Chocolatey package to do this work it makes it very easy to install the license on client machines, and also makes it very easy to upgrade when a new license is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hl6q3ke3CX0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id="install-chocolatey-on-client-machines"&gt;Install Chocolatey on client machines&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at what is necessary to complete the installation of Chocolatey onto a client machine, using all of the new infrastructure (Nexus, Jenkins, etc) that we now have in place.  This takes the form of a ClientSetup.ps1 file, which can be executed on any machine, which will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Chocolatey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure Chocolatey with sources, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install required packages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this video covers the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-setup-offline-installation#exercise-6-installing-chocolatey-on-client-machines"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; that is on the Chocolatey website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="install-jenkins"&gt;Install Jenkins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, which is part of a series of videos focusing on using Chocolatey within an Organisation, we look at what is required to download and install Jenkins, a CI/CD platform, which will allow us to automate the usage of Chocolatey Package Internalizer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this video covers the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-setup-internal-package-repository"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; that is on the Chocolatey website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="configuring-jenkins-part-1"&gt;Configuring Jenkins Part 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at configuring our new installation of Jenkins.  This will include the setup of three jobs within Jenkins which will perform the work of syncing between our internal repository and the Chocolatey Community Repository, as well as allowing the internalization of new packages into our internal repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is broken into two videos, since it takes a little while to setup, and we also ran into a small issue with the documentation (which has since been rectified) which meant things took a little longer than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this video covers the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/how-to-setup-internal-package-repository"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; on the Chocolatey Website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="configuring-jenkins-part-2"&gt;Configuring Jenkins Part 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at configuring our new installation of Jenkins.  This will include the setup of three jobs within Jenkins which will perform the work of syncing between our internal repository and the Chocolatey Community Repository, as well as allowing the internalization of new packages into our internal repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="ccm-overview"&gt;CCM Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we have a quick recap of what we have completed so far in this series, and then look ahead at what still needs to be done to setup and install Chocolatey Central Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rn5RrMkYEtQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id="set-up-ccm-database"&gt;Set up CCM Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we perform the steps that are necessary to install the Chocolatey Central Management Database.  Using SQL Server Management Studio, we verify that the schema and seed data is correctly deployed.  Installing the database is the first of three components that need to be installed in order to get started with CCM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this video covers what is &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/central-management-setup-database"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; on the Chocolatey website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U39o6qzyigQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h3 id="set-up-ccm-service"&gt;Set up CCM Service&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we perform the steps necessary to install the Chocolatey Central Management Service.  This is the second CCM component, and after getting the CCM Database installed, we can move onto installing the Windows Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this video covers what is &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/central-management-setup-service"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; on the Chocolatey website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="set-up-ccm-web"&gt;Set up CCM Web&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we perform the steps required to install the Chocolatey Central Management Website.  This is the last component in the set of three that is required to run CCM.  We finish the video by logging into the website and changing the default password, and make sure that sending of email is working (for this we make use of the papercut application).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of this video cover what is &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/central-management-setup-web"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; on the Chocolatey website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="set-up-client-for-ccm"&gt;Set up client for CCM&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at enrolling a client machine in our environment into both Chocolatey Central Management Reporting and Deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is as simple as running three Chocolatey commands, and once completed, and ensured that this is working, we add these commands into our ClientSetup.ps1 file, so that future client installations will automatically be added into Chocolatey Central Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of this video covers what is &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/central-management-setup-client"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; on the Chocolatey website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="creating-ccm-deployments"&gt;Creating CCM Deployments&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, we look at creating some CCM Deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This uses the new Deployments functionality in Chocolatey Central Management 0.3.0.  We create two different deployments.  The first it to remediate some issues which we have found across the 7 machines within our environment, namely that the Chocolatey GUI package is outdated on one machine, and is also installed on a machine that it shouldn't be.  These issues are both fixed in the same deployment.  The second deployment is to installed the Notepad++ package on all the machines in the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of these deployments we are able to watch in real time as the different steps are executed, and to see the logs from the installations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jpdz0SDvD4M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;I quite often get asked questions around how to set up Chocolatey in the context of an Organisation, i.e. How do I create my own repository?  How can I internalize packages into my own feed?  How can I install Chocolatey offline?  And various others over the years.  A lot of this is already documented on the Chocolatey website, however, it can't always be the easiest to find, something that we are working on.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>How to verify SQL Server connection using udl file</title>
		<updated>2020-08-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;This is something that I always forget how to do, until that day when I really need it, so I thought I would create a blog post and a short video to remind myself how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, when you need to test a connection to a SQL Server instance, create a new text file (doesn't matter what it is called) and change the extension to be &amp;quot;udl&amp;quot;.  With that done, double click on the file, and it should open up a Data Link Properties window.  In this window, provide the SQL Server connection details that you are trying to verify:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;server/instance name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows Authentication/SQL Server Authentication details&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database name&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have provided all the details, simply click the Test Connection button, and things will either work, or they won't.  With this information, you can then populate the configuration file that you are trying to fill in, or perform the installation of the application that needs the information, or whatever it is, knowing that the details you have provided are correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This trick has saved me a number of times, and I hope that it helps you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow along with a short video where I show this in action below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-N0K08q3jrw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

		<title>Chocolatey swag over the years</title>
		<updated>2020-06-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I have been involved in the Chocolatey project in one way or another for a lot of years, and in that time, I have collected a lot of Chocolatey swag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn't until I was clearing out a few things, and looking at other collections of swag that I had, that I thought it would be a good idea to collect all of it into one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might get the order of the creation of these wrong, or where they were given out, but I am hoping that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder"&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; will be able to help out here to put them in the correct order, and also to provide more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t-shirts"&gt;T-Shirts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-choco-experience-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Experience" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first official Chocolatey t-shirt which was created as part of the Chocolatey Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-choco-experience-white-small.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Experience - White" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This t-shirt was also available in white (I chose to go for the black version).  A photo of the white version was provided by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/punker76"&gt;Jan Karger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-choco-auto-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Automation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on from the Kickstarter design, this became the default Chocolatey t-shirt for a long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chocoio-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey.io" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a slight variation on the default t-shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chocoio-colour-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey.io colour" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think many of these ones were made, but it is one of my favourites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chocofest-front-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Fest Front" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chocofest-back-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Fest Back" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the official t-shirt of the inaugural Chocolatey Conference, Chocolatey Fest, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-polo-grey-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Grey Polo Shirt" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-polo-navy-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Navy Polo Shirt" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These ones are polo-shirts, which are only available to Chocolatey Employees and Contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-pshsummit-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="PSH Summit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was given out to attendees of PSH Summit in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-chefconf-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="ChefConf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This t-shirt was given out to attendees at ChefConf in 2019, both here in the UK, and in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-ansiblefest-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="AnsibleFest" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This t-shirt was given out at the AnsibleFest conference in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-strawberry-front-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Strawberry Front" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-strawberry-back-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Strawberry Back" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a limited edition run, featuring the &amp;quot;Config Management Strawberry Dipped in Chocolatey&amp;quot;, created by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adilio"&gt;Adil&lt;/a&gt;.  This was given out in very limited numbers to attendees of both AnsibleFest and Puppetize.  There aren't many of these in the wild, so definitely a collectors item if you have one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-puppetize-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Puppetize" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was given out to attendees of Puppetize in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-arcreactor-blue-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Arc Reactor Blue" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-arcreactor-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Arc Reactor Grey" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adilio"&gt;Adil&lt;/a&gt; design, and it is available in blue and grey, and it is inspired by the arc reactor from Iron Man.  I believe I am right in saying that the blue one is only available to Employees and Contractors for Chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hoodies"&gt;Hoodies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/hoodie-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hoodie" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was available to some Kickstarter backers, depending on what level you backed the project with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jacket"&gt;Jacket&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/jacket-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Jacket" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the Microsoft MVP Jacket, there is an official Chocolatey Jacket available to Chocolatey Employees and Contractors.  This is an amazing quality jacket!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hat"&gt;Hat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/hat-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hat Back" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/hat1-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hat Front Right" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/hat2-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hat Front Left" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was created by my colleague &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steviecoaster"&gt;Stevie&lt;/a&gt;, and I absolutely love it!  These were made in a very small quantity, and you should count yourself very lucky if you have one.  This is my go to hat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolate"&gt;Chocolate&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/chocolate-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolate" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yes, in addition to creating a Package Manager for Windows, we have also created some Chocolate.  This was given out to attendees at Chocolatey Fest in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stickers"&gt;Stickers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Sticker" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have literally given out 1000's of these at various conferences over the years!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker3-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Fest" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This sticker was given out to all attendees at Chocolatey inaugural conference Chocolatey Fest, in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker2-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Golden Ticket" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In keeping with the Willy Wonka theme of Chocolatey Fest, the Chocolatey Golden Ticket sticker was created.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonably new design created by my colleague &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adilio"&gt;Adil&lt;/a&gt;.  It can be found in a couple different sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sponsorship-swag"&gt;Sponsorship Swag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lanyards"&gt;Lanyards&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/lanyard1-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="WinOps Lanyard" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sponsor of the WinOps events, Chocolatey has appeared on their lanyards at least a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/lanyard2-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Fest Lanyard" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you attended Chocolatey Fest, you may well have kept a hold of yours as well!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/lanyard3.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="KCDC 2018" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendees of KCDC in 2018 were lucky enough to get one of these!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bags"&gt;Bags&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sponsorswag-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="WinOps Bag" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Chocolatey logo has appeared on a number of WinOps bag which are given out to all attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t-shirts-1"&gt;T-Shirts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sponsorswag3-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="PowerShell Summit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you attended the PowerShell Summit in 2018, you will find the Chocolatey Logo on the back!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sponsorswag6-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="WinOps" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chocolatey Logo appears on pretty much all the WinOps t-shirts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="unofficial-but-still-awesome"&gt;Unofficial - but still awesome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t-shirts-2"&gt;T-Shirts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/tshirt-unofficial-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey and Boxstarter" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schusterfredl"&gt;Manfred Wallner&lt;/a&gt; (a Chocolatey Community Member), this is a t-shirt showing the combination of Chocolatey and Boxstarter, which was the topic of his talk at the WinOps Conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="stickers-1"&gt;Stickers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker-unofficial-boxstarter-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Boxstarter" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schusterfredl"&gt;Manfred&lt;/a&gt; also took the time to create a sticker version of the t-shirt design that he created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/06/20/sticker4-small.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Rob The Founder" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was created by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steviecoaster"&gt;Stevie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adilio"&gt;Adil&lt;/a&gt; for the Founder of Chocolatey, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder"&gt;Rob Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>2019 - A Retrospective</title>
		<updated>2020-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;This was a blog post that was meant to be written at the start of January, but with one thing or another, it didn't get done, but finally able to publish it, so here goes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2018-a-retrospective"&gt;last years retrospective blog post&lt;/a&gt; I mentioned the old cliché of saying that the year had passed very quickly.  Well here I am a year on, saying exactly the same thing, if not even quicker!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our eldest child has moved into Primary 2 and is loving it.  It is great to see her learning so any things, and soaking it all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Alivia.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Alivia" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our youngest will be starting nursery in the first quarter of 2020, and I still can't quite believe it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Amelia-The-Tiger.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Amelia The Tiger" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home still allows me to help out with school/activity drop offs and pickups, so I am still in a fortunate position where I get to spend much more time with the children than I otherwise would if I had a typical office job.  I am very grateful for that opportunity, and I honestly couldn't see myself going back to working from an office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having said that, the daily commute can be a little hazardous sometimes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Office-Commute.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Office-Commute" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="looking-back-on-2019"&gt;Looking back on 2019&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I thought &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2018-a-retrospective"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; was busy, 2019 has been even more busy!  I have done a number of work and personal trips, totalling 48,382 km, and visiting 3 countries and 11 cities.  It has all been a little bit of a blur!  One of the reasons that I like to write these blog posts is to look back on what I have done, and where I have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="working-at-chocolatey"&gt;Working at Chocolatey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has now been two years that I have been working full time for Chocolatey, and I am still thoroughly enjoying it.  Working remotely has had it challenges, but I believe what both I, the family, and also work, have settled into a nice routine, and it has been working out really well.  The additional time at home with the family is amazing, and I wouldn't change it for the world!  The converted garage, which is now the office, is working out really well, also on the colder mornings, espeically over Winter, it has been a thought to go outside to turn the heating on, and it does take a little while for the room to get up to temperature!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the main things that I have been working on this year at Chocolatey is our new Chocolatey Central Management offering, and in June, after a beta period, we released the first 0.1.0 version.  This initial release was all about bringing the available information for each machine using Chocolatey, i.e. the list of packages installed, which ones are outdated, etc, to one central location, which can then be reported on.  This has been a very interesting project to work on, and it has been great to see it ship to our customers.  There are many exciting plans for other modules which are going to be added to CCM, and I am looking forward to working on them in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2019, the Chocolatey Team has been expanding, and it has been great getting to know and working with everyone.  The in person events throughout the year have been a great opportunity to concrete the relationships.  Although we chat every day on standup, there is no real substitute to chatting in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="archery"&gt;Archery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I was at University, I was a member of both the University Basketball Team, as well as the Archery Team (even for a couple of years being the Captain of the Team).  While I haven't played Basketball in a LONG time, I have always thought about starting Archery again.  Back at the start of 2019, I found out that there was actually a local Archery club in my home town, something which I never knew.  I decided that I would go along, and I have been a regular attendee ever since.  In July, I made a trip to London to visit the Quicks Archery store, just outside London, and I bought my own bow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am still not quite back at the same level as I was when I shot in the University team, but things are getting better.  At the end of December, I scored 506 in a Portsmouth round (60 arrows at 20 yards (18 metres)).  I was very happy to crack the 500 barrier, something which I had got close to a couple other times through the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Archery-Not-Bad.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Archery Not Bad" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also decided that my quiver is the perfect place to put some of the pins that I have been collecting over the years:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Archery-Quiver.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Archery Quiver" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="speaking-tour"&gt;Speaking Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in January, and going into February, I &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2019-speaking-tour"&gt;went on the road&lt;/a&gt; and presented at a number of .Net User Groups.  This included talks on Chocolatey, Cake, and also a new talk on using Packer, Vagrant and Terraform.  This was my second time doing this, and again, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I don't have any immediate plans to do anything like this in 2020, but things might change here, and I will keep you all posted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="trips"&gt;Trips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons that 2019 seems to have been a complete blur is that I did a number of trips.  There were 7 in total, which saw me visiting the States 4 times!  So far for 2020, I have 2 trips booked to visit the States again, but hoping to not do quite as many trips this year, I think I am getting too old for it :smile:!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mvp-summit"&gt;MVP Summit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wasn't able to attend the MVP Summit, and when I was renewed again, I thought I better take the opportunity to go at least once, in case I don't get renewed again.  This was my first time visiting the Microsoft Campus on Redmond, and for a long time &amp;quot;Microsoft Fanboy&amp;quot; this was a huge thing for me.  The campus itself is HUGE, and it is difficult to grasp the scale of it until you have visited.  What made attending the MVP Summit even more special for me this year was that all members of the Cake Team were in attendance.  I had met a couple of the team before in person, but this was the first time meeting the majority of them, and the first time that we had all been in one place.  This made it very special.  One evening we had a Cake get together and worked on some of the open issues on the GitHub repository.  Being in the same place made certain discussions far easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Cake-Team-And-Friends.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Cake Team and Friends" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst walking around the campus, there is a section where all the various Microsoft products and remembered forever in the pavement of the walkway.  Couldn't help snapping a photo of this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Microsoft-Sourcesafe-Pavement.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Microsoft SourceSafe" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also able to grab some time to go and visit a friend who works on Campus, and I thought the visitors badge was pretty cool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Microsoft-Visitor-Badge.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Microsoft Visitor Badge" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We weren't able to get into them, but we also went and found the Microsoft Treehouse meeting rooms that we had been told about.  I have to say, they are very impressive:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Microsoft-Treehouse.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Microsoft-Treehouse" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I had a great time at the Summit, it was a LONG week, with lots to take in, so at the end of the week, I was ready to go home.  Wandering around during the summit was great fun, as it meant that you had the opportunity to speak/meet lots of people, most of which I have only interacted with online, it was great to meet people in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the Cake Team made a visit to the Space Needle, which I have to say was really good.  We were there on a very nice day, so the views from the top were stunning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Space-Needle.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Space Needle" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Looking-Down.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Looking Down" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already decided to attend the MVP Summit again this year, so looking forward to meeting everyone again in person!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="chefconf"&gt;ChefConf&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first work trip for 2019 took me to Seattle to attend Chef Conf.  Chocolatey was a sponsor of this event, and I spent most of my time working on the booth and chatting to folks either already using Chocolatey, or who were going to be using it.  All in all, it was a great event!  I got to meet in person for the first time Stevie, who recently joined the company, so it was great getting to know him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Setting-Up-At-Chef-Conf.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Setting Up at Chef Conf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was there, I also presented my talk on Chocolatey and Chef, and I am happy to say that I got a lot of good feedback from the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="chefconf-london"&gt;ChefConf London&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on from the Chef Conf in Seattle, I also attended the Chef Conf London event.  Once again, Chocolatey was a sponsor at the event, and I was working on the booth chatting about all things Chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I presented the same Chocolatey and Chef talk that I did in Seattle, and once again, I am happy to say that I got a lot of great feedback from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Talk-At-Chef-Conf.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Talk at Chef Conf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hack-yourself-first"&gt;Hack Yourself First&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been a long time follower of both Scott Helme and Troy Hunt, and when I found out that Scott was going to be giving Troy's &amp;quot;Hack Yourself First&amp;quot; course, I jumped at the chance to attend.  Scott was doing the conference in a couple of places, including Glasgow, which would have been easier to get to for me, but I opted to attend the London event.  This was for an alterior motive though!  Since starting Archery earlier this year, I decided that I wanted to buy my own bow, so I added an extra day and hire a car (it was amazing) to allow me to travel to the Quicks Archery store just outside London so that I could buy a bow.  I spent a good few hours at the store deciding on what to get, and I am not disappointed with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/The-Hire-Car.png" class="img-fluid" alt="The Hire Car" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/The-Bow-Bits.png" class="img-fluid" alt="The Bow Bits" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/The-Bow-Assembled.png" class="img-fluid" alt="The Bow Assembled" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, back to the course...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was very good, and very well presented.  To say that I have walked away more scared than when I went in pretty much sums it up, but I do feel a little bit better equipped at recognizing and dealing with certain types of problems that we all face on our day to day usage of the Internet.  If you are interested at all in the topics of hacking, and security, then I would definitely recommend that you check up this session if Scott decides to do them again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kcdc"&gt;KCDC&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard so many good things about this conference, so when I found out that my talk submission had been accepted, I was very excited to attend.  This event did not disappoint!  The venue and the quality of the sessions on offer were very high, and I would thoroughly recommend anyone to check out this event!  The prize give aways at the end of the event were quite simply amazing, so if you do go, make sure to stay all the way to the end for your chance to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also do REALLY cool t-shirts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/KCDC.png" class="img-fluid" alt="KCDC" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the fact that the Chocolatey office is SO close to this event, I hired a car and drove up to meet Rob and to see the Chocolatey office in person.  When I &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; got there (the whole ordeal of hiring a car and actually getting to where I needed to be is a LONG story), it was great to meet up with Rob and to be shown around the office.  Rob has worked really hard on putting the office together, and I have to say that it is looking really good.  I am looking forward to heading back to the office later this year to meet up with the rest of the team!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was only one of the problems that I had on this trip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/No-GPS.png" class="img-fluid" alt="No GPS" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I got there:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Chocolatey-Office.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Office" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But damn it was hot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Its-hot.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Its hot" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="winops-london"&gt;WinOps London&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the tradition of attending WinOps (this is now my fifth time), I attended with my collegues Paul and Mukesh.  Chocolatey was a sponsor of the event, so we had a booth there to chat to folks.  Similar to last year, some of the Chocolatey Community members based in Europe attended the event, so it was great to catch up with them, as well as to finally meet some folks in person, like Maurice and Kim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Chocolatey-Folks-At-WinOps.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Folks at WinOps" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While at the conference, Paul and I presented our workshop on using Chocolatey within the Organisation, and I am happy to say that we got some really good feedback on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/WinOps-Workshop.png" class="img-fluid" alt="WinOps Workshop" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="microsoft-ignite"&gt;Microsoft Ignite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first time attending a large Microsoft event, and to say that it is a different scale is a little bit of an understatement!  The events that I normally attend cap out at around 500 folks, but Microsoft Ignite had something like over 20000 attendees!  It was HUGE!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolatey was a sponsor of the event, so I spent most of my time on our booth chatting to folks about Chocolatey, giving out t-shirts (with the new Ark Reactor design created by Adil), and answering questions on Chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/How-Many-Tshirts.png" class="img-fluid" alt="How Many T-Shirts" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The booth was very busy for the whole event, but I did get some time to wander round the venue to check out the rest of the complex, including finding my name on the MVP Wall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/MVP-Wall.png" class="img-fluid" alt="MVP Wall" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a VERY cool coin press, which allowed you to create the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Pressed-Pennies.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Pressed Pennies" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are a great addition to my collection!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Thursday night, all attendees were welcomed to Universal Studios, and the whole team went along to go on some of the rides.  It was all great fun, thoroughly enjoyed it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Universal-Studios.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Universal Studios" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="microsoft-mvp"&gt;Microsoft MVP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/mvp-renewal-2019"&gt;July&lt;/a&gt;, I was once again renewed as a Microsoft MVP.  I am still humbled to be included in such a group of incredible people!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/MVP-Profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="MVP Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/MVP-Award.png" class="img-fluid" alt="MVP Award" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was great fun to get the MVP package delivered, and to add another year onto the award.  The instructions still crack me up!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been very happy to see the download counts on some of my Visual Studio Code and Azure DevOps extensions increasing over the year, especially the Chocolatey ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Visual-Studio-Marketplace.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Visual Studio Marketplace" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one point, one of my extensions was even trending on the marketplace front page :smile:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Visual-Studio-Marketplace-Trending.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Visual Studio Marketplace Trending" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cake"&gt;Cake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cake continues to grow, and in 2019, we had 7 releases.  It has been interesting to watch how the .Net Core Global Tool has been out pacing the full .Net Framework version.  For example, at the time of writing this blog post, the 0.36.0 version (which shipped 2 weeks ago) of the .Net Global Tool has been downloaded 87,253 times, where as the full .Net Framework version has been downloaded 38,365 times.  The .Net Global tool has well over double the amount of downloads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, the Cake team, recently had a team meeting, and we have been discussing releasing, finally, a 1.0.0, release of Cake.  This is something that I think we are &amp;quot;close&amp;quot; to doing, so keep an eye on that shipping.  Realistically, this won't change anything in your day to day usage of Cake, but it is something that we have been discussing doing for a while, so it will be good to finally ship it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cake-contrib"&gt;Cake Contrib&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cake-Contrib Organisation has continued to grow through 2019, now there are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;83 people are now a member of the Organisation on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;168 Repositories now in the Organisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;277 Packages associated with the cake-contrib user on NuGet.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;16,702,987 downloads of addins and modules associated with the cake-contrib user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting all the Cake Contrib addins into one place, and all maintainers working together was a main focus of mine through 2019.  A lot of the streams that I did on Twitch was centred on this topic, mainly due to the amazing work of &lt;a href="https://github.com/Jericho"&gt;Jericho&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.AddinDiscoverer"&gt;Cake.AddinDiscover&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-contrib/Home/blob/master/Audit_for_Cake_0.33.0.md"&gt;daily report&lt;/a&gt; of the current state of the addins.  On this topic, I was very happy to see Jericho welcomed into the Cake Maintainer team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gitreleasemanager"&gt;GitReleaseManager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, GitReleaseManager has been in maintenance mode, as it &amp;quot;just&amp;quot; works for what I needed it for.  However, in 2019, it has seen a lot of work, getting new features, including shipping as a .Net Global Tool.  Huge thanks here to Artur and Kim for the nudge to invest time in this tool again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gitversion"&gt;GitVersion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven't really been involved in the day to day running of the GitVersion project for a while, I have left that in the hands of Artur and Asbjørn who have been doing an amazing job, but I have been doing some work in the background.  Including making sure that all team members have access to everything that is required, like passwords, and access to different systems.  In addition, I set up a Slack Team to allow chatting within the team.  Finally, I worked on converting the documentation for GitVersion to use Wyam and for it to be hosted on GitHub pages.  This was a little bit of work, but I am happy with the end results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="github-organisations"&gt;GitHub Organisations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2019, I made a concerted effort of move all of my Open Source contributions into one of a few GitHub Organisations and to not leave them in my own personal GitHub account.  The idea behind this effort was to allow for the continuity of these projects, should something happen to me.  In the GitHub Organisations that I have created, I have ensured that there are multiple owners added to the Organisation, in some cases, these people don't make active contributions to the repositories in the Organisation, but they are people that I trust to do the right thing with the repositories if/when required.  This is quite a morbid thing to think about, but having been in a situation where we were forced to decide what to do after the death of a Cake Community member, I wanted to make sure that my &amp;quot;house&amp;quot; was in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also set up a number of Organisations for Chocolatey, and moved some repositories around, to make it clear about what projects were actively supported by Chocolatey, and which ones are community driven efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nuget-profile"&gt;NuGet Profile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I worked on creating a few new Cake Addins, mainly ones that are being used at work.  As a result, I have a few more packages than last year, and the total download count for all packages has almost doubled!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/NuGet-Profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="NuGet Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="chocolatey-profile"&gt;Chocolatey Profile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I am writing this, I am not entirely sure why my number of packages on Chocolatey has gone down by one, but as mentioned in last years post, the continued increase in the popularity of Chocolatey is certainly helping my download count number here!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be rude of me not to mention again the overhaul that the Chocolatey Community Repository received in 2019.  It is looking so good now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Chocolatey-Profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="net-foundation"&gt;.NET Foundation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, I became a fully signed up member of the .Net Foundation.  I also put myself forward to nomination in the Board of Directors for the Foundation, but I wasn't selected to become member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-contributions"&gt;GitHub Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is fair to say that I might have got carried away again in 2019 when it comes to GitHub!  Contributions more than doubled in 2019 compared to the previous year.  In part this was a result of my day to day job, but also due in part to the regular streaming that I have been doing on Twitch.  This has given me the opportunity to work on a number of projects, and I am very grateful for dedicated time that I am allowed to do this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/GitHub-Profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also lucky enough to be one of the people who were sent the following to celebrate 100 million repositories being created on GitHub.  It takes pride of place on my desk at work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/100-million-repos.png" class="img-fluid" alt="100 Million Repos" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hacktoberfest"&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, continuing the yearly tradition (I think this is now my fifth year), I took part in Hacktoberfest, and was able to complete the event, which resulted in me obtaining some very cool swag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Hacktoberfest-Swag.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hacktoberfest Swag" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was an &lt;a href="https://circleci.com/blog/join-the-party-get-your-hacktoberfest-prs-with-circleci-orbs/"&gt;additional give away this year from the folks at CircleCI&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to get in on the action here, and grab myself another free t-shirt!  What can I say, I am a sucker for a free t-shirt!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Orbtoberfest-Swag.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Orbtoberfest Swag" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pull-requests"&gt;24 Pull Requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notable absence in 2019, at least in my mind, was that there wasn't a 24 Pull Requests event.  I have taken part in this event every year since 2015, but this year Andrew decided that he was going to take a break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was actually an issue created looking for a &lt;a href="https://github.com/24pullrequests/24pullrequests/issues/2469"&gt;new maintainer&lt;/a&gt; to step up to help.  However, I don't think anyone came forward to help with this, and as a result, it was decided to take a year off.  Hopefully, this will be back in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stack-overflow-contributions"&gt;Stack Overflow Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to last year, I have continued to answer questions on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitFlow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitVersion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, my overall reputation has gone up to 11021 (an increase of 3985).  However, that quite large jump isn't just from me answering questions.  &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/11/13/were-rewarding-the-question-askers/"&gt;Stack Overflow recently changed the rules&lt;/a&gt; so that instead of getting 5 points for an upvote on a question, you would instead get 10 points.  This was back dated, and as a result of my &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30024353/how-to-use-visual-studio-code-as-default-editor-for-git"&gt;question here&lt;/a&gt; I got a big jump in overall points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Stack-Overflow-Reputation.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Reputation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also saw an increase in the numbers of badges that I have been awarded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Stack-Overflow-Badges.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Badges" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Silver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 Bronze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my impact increased to 331k (an increase of 106k):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Stack-Overflow-Impact.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Impact" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="youtube-videos"&gt;YouTube videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main focus in 2019 for my YouTube channel was to serve as an archive for the live streams that I have been doing on Twitch, however, I did upload a number of short videos for releases to projects that I have been working on.  One of the things that I have been working on this year is an update to Chocolatey GUI as well as updating the documentation for it.  Along with that, I am planning on creating a number of tutorial videos to show how new functionality works.  So keep an eye out for those being published to the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one reason or another, I have a backlog of streams to upload to YouTube.  This is on my list of things to do, and I will hopefully get to that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't seem to have noted this in last years blog post, but I now have 115 subscribers to the channel.  If you want to get notifications about new videos being published, be sure to subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="twitch"&gt;Twitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, I started streaming on Twitch, and aside from some breaks for travelling and a couple other things, I have been streaming regularly throughout 2019 on a Monday evening (8PM my local time), and Friday lunch times (12PM my local time).  You can find my &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gep13"&gt;Twitch channel here&lt;/a&gt;.  It is no exaggeration to say that I have got a LOT out of doing this.  I am hopeful that viewers of the stream are also getting something out of it as well :smile:.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Twitch-Profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Twitch Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the streams we have worked on projects like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cake.Recipe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updating Cake-Contrib Addins&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitReleaseManager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolatey VSCode Extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poshbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A secret project called devgep (that still needs to be finished)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chef Client&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;numerous other things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was also lucky enough to bring guests onto the stream, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rob Reynolds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mattias Karlsson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maurice Kevenaar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Martin Björkström&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrik Svensson&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dedicated time slots for doing &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot; has been great, and it has helped me focus on shipping some of the projects that I work on.  The &amp;quot;pairing&amp;quot; sessions that happen during the stream are amazing, and I think it is fair to say that I learn something new on every stream.  I am very grateful to the regular attendees on the stream, and I hope to work with you all more in 2020 on various projects!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2019, I was invited to become a Twitch Affiliate, which I am happy to say I took them up on.  In addition, I was invited to join the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/team/livecoders"&gt;Live Coders Team&lt;/a&gt; on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aberdeen-developers"&gt;Aberdeen Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers is still going strong, but I have had very little involvement in the group in 2019.  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nyami"&gt;Douglas Cameron&lt;/a&gt; has once again been the driving force behind it.  I have just helped out on the sidelines where/where I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year saw 6 events (one of them I presented), including talks on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/CWlURN0pFnI"&gt;Immutable Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FxOSm6NUVnY"&gt;Bots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Acqcg5MQbaU"&gt;Vue.JS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GBOV5zyFVVM"&gt;Aurelia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/AYdlDbnSHNU"&gt;C# 8&lt;/a&gt; (with Jon Skeet!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Jon-Skeet-ADNUG.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Jon Skeet at ADNUG" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2019, the group started streaming their events on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/adnuguk"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and uploading the videos to their &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRnxcmrSrc4TWKqakE4EViw"&gt;YouTube Channel&lt;/a&gt;.  So if you are not able to make it along in person, then you always have the opportunity to watch the sessions back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to buy this equipment was a result of the successful &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group"&gt;gofundme&lt;/a&gt; campaign which we ran.  We are very thankful to everyone who contributed to this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-hat"&gt;Chocolatey Hat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be completely wrong of me not to mention that absolutely amazing Chocolatey Hat that I got this year.  This was desgined and sourced by Stevie, and it is my goto hat nowadays, I love it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Choco-Hat-Front.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Choco Hat Front" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="organ-donation"&gt;Organ Donation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly morbid topic of conversation, but this year I signed up to be an organ donar.  This is something I have been thinking about for a while, and I finally got around to it this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/Organ-Donar.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Organ Donar" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="irn-bru-1901"&gt;Irn-Bru 1901&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year also saw the release of a special edition of Irn-Bru, using the original (full sugar) recipe from 1901.  It is very tasty!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2020/02/01/1901.png" class="img-fluid" alt="1901" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="office-hours"&gt;Office Hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was hoping to continue to provide help to anyone that wanted it in 2019, but unfortunately, the officehours.io service which I had been using closed its doors, and as a result, I wasn't able to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thats-a-wrap"&gt;That's a wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is it for another year!  Overhaul, it has been a very enjoyable year, and looking forward to doing more of the same in 2020.  I hope 2019 was good for all of you as well, and I look forward to talking to you all in 2010!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>MVP Renewal 2019</title>
		<updated>2019-07-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce that I have been renewed as a Microsoft MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--excerpt--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday was sort of a weird day for me.  I had no expectations of being renewed as a Microsoft MVP, and I was very happy to receive the email from the MVP Global Administator to say that I was being renewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching Twitter throughout the day, and talking to some OSS colleagues who were also waiting to see if they were being renewed, the tension grew throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 13:39 I received the following email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/07/02/mvp_renewal_2019.png" class="img-fluid" alt="MVP Renewal 2019" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will be my third year as a Microsoft MVP.  It was also this year that I was able to attend the MVP Summit in Redmond, and I am looking forward to attending this Summit again next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to say congratulations to all the MVP's who were renewed this year, and to any MVP's who were no renewed &lt;strong&gt;thank you&lt;/strong&gt; for your contributions to the Community, they are very much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweeted about this here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Very happy to say that I have just got a confirmation email to say that I have been renewed as a Microsoft MVP :-) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MVPAward?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;&amp;#64;MVPAward&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MVPBuzz?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MVPBuzz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3d2YXJMKzT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3d2YXJMKzT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gary Ewan Park (&amp;#64;gep13) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gep13/status/1145693764020817921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 1, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

		<title>New Chocolatey GitHub Organisations</title>
		<updated>2019-04-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking a LOT about GitHub Organisations lately.  These thought processes are related to the sustainability and maintainability of GitHub repositories/projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most recent thing that spurred this was detailed in a Twitter thread that I created here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thread on OSS... A couple weeks ago, I was contacted about a couple &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cakebuildnet?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;&amp;#64;cakebuildnet&lt;/a&gt; addins, which appeared to have stopped being maintained.  It was suggested that we could fork the addin&amp;#39;s into the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cakecontrib?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;&amp;#64;cakecontrib&lt;/a&gt; Organisation and continue development there.  I was hesitant to... 1/n&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Gary Ewan Park (&amp;#64;gep13) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gep13/status/1115340392197709824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 8, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The upshot of this was a successful outcome, where the repository in question was transferred into a GitHub Organisation, which is maintained by multiple people, meaning that more people can help out with ongoing changes to these repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This got me thinking about my own GitHub profile, as I have a growing number of my own repositories that are starting to get more and more contributions from other people.  I have added these contributors as collaborators on the repository, but they don't have full access to the repositories.  The ability to add this access, to the best of my knowledge, only comes with adding the contributors to an organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-have-to-do-with-chocolatey"&gt;What does this have to do with Chocolatey?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the most recent repositories that I have been working on are focused on Chocolatey, specifically:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/chocolatey-vs"&gt;chocolatey-vs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/chocolatey-vscode"&gt;chocolatey-vscode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/chocolatey-azuredevops"&gt;chocolatey-azuredevops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these started out as my own &amp;quot;pet&amp;quot; projects, they are starting to gain more traction and contributions, and it makes sense to move them into the correct Organisation.  This will likely ultimately be the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey"&gt;chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; Organisation on GitHub, but it started a discussion between myself and Chocolatey Founder, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder"&gt;Rob Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repositories in the chocolatey GitHub Organisation fall into three distinct categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repositories that are actively being worked on by the core Chocolatey Contributors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repositories that are actively being worked on by the wider Chocolatey Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;repositories that are no longer being worked on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having identified these distinctions, the following changes are going to happen...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="new-github-organisations"&gt;New GitHub Organisations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two new GitHub Organisations have been created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey-archive"&gt;chocolatey-archive&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is going to house all Chocolatey repositories that are no longer being worked on, but which are being kept around for reference purposes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey-community"&gt;chocolatey-community&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is going to house all Chocolatey repositories that are being worked on by the wider Chocolatey Community&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existing &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey"&gt;chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; Organisation will remain, and will house all the repositories that are actively being developed by the core Chocolatey Contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-going-to-happen-now"&gt;What is going to happen now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have already moved all the required repositories into the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey-archive"&gt;chocolatey-archive&lt;/a&gt; Organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next week or so, I will begin moving repositories into the new &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey-community"&gt;chocolatey-community&lt;/a&gt; Organisation.  To facilitate this, I will also be sending out invitations to Chocolatey Community members to join the new Organisation, and assigning them into teams in the new organisation.  If you are already a member of the chocolatey Organisation, you will likely be invited to the new Organisation as well.  If I can ask you to keep an eye out for this invitation so that I can assign members into the various teams I will create, I would appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope that this re-organisation of the repositories associated with Chocolatey will help to explain what they are for, and who is actively working on the various projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information about the Chocolatey repositories that exist, you can read an earlier &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/what-are-all-the-chocolatey-repositories-for"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that I wrote on this subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions about any of these changes.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Introducing the Cake.VsCode.Recipe Package</title>
		<updated>2019-02-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;This post is about the newly released &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.VsCode.Recipe/"&gt;Cake.VsCode.Recipe&lt;/a&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-it"&gt;What is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cake.VsCode.Recipe, whose source code can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-contrib/Cake.VsCode.Recipe"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is an opinionated set of scripts for &lt;a href="https://cakebuild.net/"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt;, specifically around the creation and publishing of an extension to the &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode"&gt;Visual Studio Code Marketplace&lt;/a&gt;.  As most of you will be aware, I am a maintainer of the Cake project, and I have a growing &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/gep13"&gt;collection of extensions&lt;/a&gt; for Visual Studio Code, so it should come as no real surprise to you that I wanted a way to reliably, and consistently, build and publish these extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-is-this-needed"&gt;Why is this needed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the Visual Studio Code extensions that I have created, and work on, I found myself writing the same build steps over and over again for building and publishing them.  In each of these projects, I was writing almost EXACTLY the same code, but with simply a few changes here and there for project specific configuration.  After a few rounds of making a modification to one projects build scripts, only to have to duplicate that work in the other projects, I decided it was time to centralize these scripts into one location.  And that is where the Cake.VsCode.Recipe package comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-does-it-do"&gt;What does it do?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to wrapping the calls to build a Visual Studio Code extension, Cake.VsCode.Recipe encompasses the complete process of publishing the extension.  In my case, this includes the creation of a Chocolatey package, which makes it incredible simple to get the extension installed on a new machine in an automated way.  The tasks that are executed by Cake.VsCode.Recipe are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Print-AppVeyor-Environment-Variables
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really a helper task.  When running on AppVeyor, it will print out all the Environment Variables used by AppVeyor.  These can be useful when debugging issues with the build process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export-Release-Notes
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can be used to export the set of generated release notes for the project, and include in the released artifacts.  This isn't enabled by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clear-AppVeyor-Cache
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another helper method.  In order to speed up build times, AppVeyor allows heavy caching of files.  From time to time, it is helpful to bust this cache, again for the purposes of debugging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show-Info
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Similar to Print-AppVeyor-Environment-Variables, this task prints out information about the current configuration of Cake.VsCode.Recipe itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tidies up the generated artifacts, ready for re-building it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update-Project-Json-Version
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This uses the output from GitVersion, to update the projects Json file with the asserted version number.  This is ultimately used to version the generated vsix and nupkg file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Npm-Install
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the contents of the package.json file, run &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; to install all required dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install-TypeScript
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In order to successfully build the Visual Studio Code extension, it is necessary to have the tsc tool installed.  This task uses npm to install this tool globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install-Vsce
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;vsce is the tool that is used to actually publish an extension to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.  Again, use npm to install this globally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Package-Extension
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This task builds and packages the Visual Studio Code extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create-Chocolatey-Package
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once the vsix file is generated, create an embedded Chocolatey Package, with the vsix file contained within it, making it very simple to install it on a new machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload-AppVeyor-Artifacts
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All artifacts from the build, i.e. the vsix and nupkg files, are uploaded to AppVeyor for later usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish-GitHub-Release
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a release of the extension is made, upload assets to the created GitHub release, again, for later usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish-Extension
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a release of the extension is made, publish the generated vsix file to the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish-Chocolatey-Package
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a release of the extension is made, publish the genereated nupkg file to Chocolatey.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean-Documentation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean any/all documentation for the project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deploy-Graph-Documentation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan the Cake dependency graph and generate some documentation around what tasks are included in the Recipe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish-Documentation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Takes the generated documentation, and publishes it to GitHub Pages.  This will use KuduSync to verify that there are actually differences in the newly generated files, compared to what is already published, and will only publish if there are differences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preview-Documentation
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When running locally, Wyam has the ability to serve the content from a webserver, which can then be viewed.  In addition, when changes are made to the documentation, it will immediately re-build and show the changes.  This is very useful when iterating over a change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of these top level tasks taken care of, it is just a case of installing Cake.VsCode.Recipe into my build process for the project I am working on, and configuring the project specific details&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="installation"&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing Cake.VsCode.Recipe into a build is done using Cake's &lt;code&gt;load&lt;/code&gt; pre-processor directive.  It is as simple as this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#load nuget:https://www.nuget.org/api/v2?package=Cake.VsCode.Recipe&amp;amp;version=0.1.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, I am telling Cake to go to NuGet and find version 0.1.0 of Cake.VsCode.Recipe, and load the scripts that it contains.  Cake will download the nupkg, extract the files into the tools folder, and then iterate through all of the &lt;code&gt;.cake&lt;/code&gt; files contained within it, into the current build.  This saves a lot of time and effort by not having to do this manually.  Then, when a new version of Cake.VsCode.Recipe is released, all that has to be done is to change the version number, and a project has the latest and greatest scripts available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="usage"&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that done, all that is required is to configure the project specific details.  For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Environment.SetVariableNames();

BuildParameters.SetParameters(context: Context,
                            buildSystem: BuildSystem,
                            title: &amp;quot;CI-CD-assets-vscode&amp;quot;,
                            repositoryOwner: &amp;quot;gep13&amp;quot;,
                            repositoryName: &amp;quot;CI-CD-assets-vscode&amp;quot;,
                            appVeyorAccountName: &amp;quot;GaryEwanPark&amp;quot;,
                            shouldRunGitVersion: true);

BuildParameters.PrintParameters(Context);

Build.Run();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things in Cake.VsCode.Recipe are done via Environment Variables.  For example, storing the credentials that are used to commit and push changes to GitHub Pages, publishing to Chocolatey and Visual Studio Code Marketplace, etc.  Out of the box, Cake.VsCode.Recipe expects these variables to be a certain name, but it is possible to override these to your own preferences.  In the script above, calling &lt;code&gt;Environment.SetVariableNames();&lt;/code&gt; simply sets these to the default values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that done, calling &lt;code&gt;SetParameters&lt;/code&gt; allows setting up specific information, such as the name of the project, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then it is simply a case of printing the parameters (purely optional), and then running the build, and job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when testing locally, all that is required is to execute either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./build.ps1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;./build.sh
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing either of these will cause the default Package-Extension task to be executed, and on completion, you will have a generated vsix file, that can be loaded into Visual Studio Code for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a CI context, you would do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;.\build.ps1 -Target &amp;quot;AppVeyor&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which would execute a different path which would cause the Publish Tasks to be called, which would, assuming it is a tagged release, result in publishing to both Chocolatey and Visual Studio Code Marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="documentation"&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find additional documentation for this package here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.VsCode.Recipe/"&gt;https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.VsCode.Recipe/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="source-code"&gt;Source Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code for this Extension can be found here:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>2019 Speaking Tour</title>
		<updated>2019-01-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of the speaking tour that I did &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2018-speaking-tour"&gt;this time last year&lt;/a&gt;, I have decided that I am going to do it all over again!  I was approached by the organisers of the HaintonDotNet User Groups to see if I would be interested in doing my Cake talk at their User Groups in Newcastle and Middlesborough.  I said that I would be, and off the back of that I was able to secure another talk at Sheffield again, and then on the way home, a stop at Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dates-and-venues"&gt;Dates and venues&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the details of the talks are shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dotnetsheff-sheffield"&gt;dotnetsheff - Sheffield&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first stop in the series has me visiting Sheffield on the 28th January 2019, to do a talk on &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registration website is here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/dotnetsheff/events/254791420/"&gt;https://www.meetup.com/dotnetsheff/events/254791420/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Kevin for helping to set this up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="haintondotnet-north-east-newcastle"&gt;HaintonDotNet - North East - Newcastle&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second stop has me visiting Newcastle to present a talk on &lt;a href="https://cakebuild.net"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt; on the 29th January 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registration website is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Tom for helping to set this up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="haintondotnet-north-east-middlesborough"&gt;HaintonDotNet - North East - Middlesborough&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third stop of the tour is Middlesborough to present the same talk on &lt;a href="https://cakebuild.net"&gt;Cake&lt;/a&gt; on the 30th January 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The registration website is here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks again to Tom for helping to set this up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="scottish-powershell-and-devops-user-groups-glasgow"&gt;Scottish PowerShell and DevOps User Groups - Glasgow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final stop on the tour has me travelling to Glasgow to do a new talk on using &lt;a href="https://www.packer.io/"&gt;Packer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.terraform.io/"&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; on the 31st January 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Paul for helping to set this up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-map"&gt;The Map&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly speaking, this will be around 900 miles of driving, and should take around 16 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's a good thing that I have just bought a couple new Audible books!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy days!  Just used up two of my credits on two new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/audible_com?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;&amp;#64;audible_com&lt;/a&gt; books!

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Hot on the heels of the speaking tour that I did &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2018-speaking-tour"&gt;this time last year&lt;/a&gt;, I have decided that I am going to do it all over again!  I was approached by the organisers of the HaintonDotNet User Groups to see if I would be interested in doing my Cake talk at their User Groups in Newcastle and Middlesborough.  I said that I would be, and off the back of that I was able to secure another talk at Sheffield again, and then on the way home, a stop at Glasgow.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>What are all the Chocolatey repositories for?</title>
		<updated>2019-01-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I recently received a Tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I hope you don&amp;#39;t mind me saying, but Chocolatey has a pretty confusing structure. one of the reasons I feel hesitant to report issues on github repos is that I&amp;#39;m not sure were to put them. the one I have just opened is for example in the wrong place :(&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Foad Sojoodi Farimani (&amp;#64;fsfarimani) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fsfarimani/status/1083460818929360896?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 10, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which got me thinking... There are 35 repositories in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey"&gt;GitHub Organisation for Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;, and if you are new to Chocolatey, it can daunting to know which repository is for what.  So I thought I would go through each repository, providing a short description about what it is.  In the absence of anything better, I have ordered the list based on how many stars it has on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's get started...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="choco"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/choco"&gt;choco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main GitHub Repository for Chocolatey.
It contains the source code for the Chocolatey CLI, which can be downloaded and installed using the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/install"&gt;instructions on this page&lt;/a&gt;.
If you encounter any problems with Chocolatey, this is likely the first place to come to see if it is a known issue, or to create a new one.
If you are going to raise an issue, please ensure that you read the issue templates to see where the best place to get an answer to your question is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey"&gt;chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the original GitHub Repository for the Chocolatey project.
The first version of Chocolatey was written using PowerShell.
In 2014, Chocolatey was rewritten in C# and the decision was taken to create a new repository.
In all likelihood, you should never need to use this repository, and likely any issue that is created on this repository will need to be moved to the other repository mentioned above.
It has been left active/visible for reference only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="boxstarter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/boxstarter"&gt;boxstarter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the Boxstarter project.
&lt;a href="https://boxstarter.org/"&gt;Boxstarter&lt;/a&gt; is built on top of Chocolatey, and it brings with it repeatable, reboot resilient Windows environment installations.
This project was originally started in 2012 by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mwrockx"&gt;Matt Wrock&lt;/a&gt;, but in 2018 this project &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/blog/boxstarter-moves-under-chocolatey-github-organization"&gt;moved&lt;/a&gt; under the Chocolatey GitHub Organisation.
You would use this repository for anything related to the Boxstarter project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolateygui"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI"&gt;ChocolateyGUI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the Chocolatey GUI project.
Chocolatey GUI is a WPF application that works alongside Chocolatey, and provides a visual interface to interact with Chocolatey.
This includes the ability to list/install/upgrade/uninstall Chocolatey Packages.
As well as the ability to add/remove Chocolatey Sources, and enable/disable Chocolatey features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/11/chocolatey-gui.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey GUI" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey.org"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.org"&gt;chocolatey.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the Chocolatey Community Repository, i.e. &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/"&gt;chocolatey.org&lt;/a&gt;.
This is an ASP.NET MVC application, and you would use this repository to ask any questions about the website itself.
&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; You should not use this repository to report problems with a particular Chocolatey package.
That should be done by following up with the package maintainer directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-coreteampackages"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages"&gt;chocolatey-coreteampackages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for all the packages on chocolatey.org that are maintained by the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/profiles/chocolatey"&gt;chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; user.
This repository is maintained by a dedicated set of volunteers.
It makes use of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/majkinetor/au"&gt;AU&lt;/a&gt; updating system.
As a result, all packages in this repository are checked for new versions every 6 hours, meaning that hundreds of packages are constantly kept up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-cookbook"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-cookbook"&gt;chocolatey-cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the &lt;a href="https://www.chef.io/"&gt;Chef&lt;/a&gt; Cookbook.
This allows the installation and maintenance of Chocolatey Packages using Chef.
You can find out more information about using this &lt;a href="https://docs.chef.io/resource_chocolatey_package.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cchoco"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/cChoco"&gt;cChoco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the Chocolatey DSC Resource.
This allows you to easy install Chocolatey packages while making use of DSC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="puppet-chocolatey"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/puppet-chocolatey"&gt;puppet-chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository used to house the official module for working with Chocolatey in Puppet, however, this has since been forked and is now maintained &lt;a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-chocolatey"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
As a result, there should be no need to interact with this repository, and at some point, it will likely be archived.
This module allow the installation of Chocolatey, management of Chocolatey config and features, and also install/update of packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="choco-wiki"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/choco-wiki"&gt;choco-wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository is a clone of the Wiki that is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/choco/wiki"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
This allows us to accept contributions to the Wiki in a way that can be administrated.
The contents of this repository are ultimately rendered in the website &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
If you want/need to change any documentation in this section of the website, this is where a PR would be raised, or issue created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-test-environment"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment"&gt;chocolatey-test-environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the local Chocolatey Test Environment, which is essentially a vagrant setup which allows you to test your Chocolatey packages.
This is the same test environment that is used by the automated moderation process when you submit a package to chocolatey.org.
If you are running into any issues with packages failing when you push them to chocolatey.org, this is the recommended way to figure out what is going on.
For more information about the moderation process for chocolatey.org you can watch this video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/35JiK0AdGqM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-oneget"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-oneget"&gt;chocolatey-oneget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the OneGet (a.k.a Package Management) Provider for Chocolatey.
If you are interested in helping with this provider, this is where you would start, as we are looking for help with this provider.
Please take note of the warnings in the readme of this repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="shimgen"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/shimgen"&gt;shimgen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the tools that ships with Chocolatey is called shimgen.
Shimgen is a tool that makes batch redirection not suck so much by generating shims that point to target executable files.
Shimgen is a commercial tool provided by RealDimensions Software, LLC (RDS) for free use with the Chocolatey client.
This repository serves as a location to raise any issues with the shimgen tool.
It does not house the source code for this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-package-requests"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-requests"&gt;chocolatey-package-requests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no source code in this repository.
Rather, this repository houses a list of issues for software applications that people would like to see added to chocolatey.org.
The idea is that anyone interested in helping with the creation of a Chocolatey package can select one from this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolateytemplates"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolateytemplates"&gt;chocolateytemplates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an older repository that houses a set of warmup templates for creating Chocolatey packages.
As of today, creating a Chocolatey package is best done using the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/commands-new"&gt;choco new&lt;/a&gt;, so most likely you will not need to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="simple-server"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/simple-server"&gt;simple-server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for a website known as the Chocolatey Simple Server, which is also known as chocolatey.server.
This is an application that you can use to house Chocolatey packages locally in your environment, rather than using chocolatey.org.
This is similar to applications like Nexus, Artifactory or ProGet.
However, this is a very basic application, that doesn't have all the features of these other applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-packages-template"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-packages-template"&gt;chocolatey-packages-template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in maintaining your own Chocolatey Packages, this repository houses a sample for how to setup your own repository.
The idea would be that you fork this repository, and tailor it to your own needs.
This repository has the suggested setup for both ketarin and AU, both of which are described &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs/automatic-packages"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
As of today, the main recommendation for automatic packaging is AU, as such, if you are starting your own repository, perhaps best to start with this &lt;a href="https://github.com/majkinetor/au-packages-template"&gt;template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="package-validator"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/package-validator"&gt;package-validator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the package-validator windows service.
This is one of the automatic moderation processes that all packages submitted to chocolatey.org go through.
For more information on this, see the video further up in this blog post.
You would raise issues here if you find any problems with this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="package-verifier"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/package-verifier"&gt;package-verifier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the package-verifier windows service.
This is one of the automatic moderation processes that all packages submitted to chocolatey.org go through.
For more information on this, see the video further up in this blog post.
You would raise issues here if you find any problems with this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nuget-chocolatey"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/nuget-chocolatey"&gt;nuget-chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses a copy of the NuGet Source Code.
Chocolatey is built on top of the NuGet Client libraries, and as such, it maintains a copy of those libraries, as some changes had to be made to make it work for Chocolatey.
As changes are made in the upstream NuGet Source Code, the relevant changes will be pulled into this repository so that they can be used in Chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="puppet-chocolatey_server"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/puppet-chocolatey_server"&gt;puppet-chocolatey_server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for a Puppet Module that can be used to automatically install/configure the chocolatey.server package.
This means, assuming you are using Puppet, you can very quickly get up and running with this application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="puppet-chocolatey-handsonlab"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/puppet-chocolatey-handsonlab"&gt;puppet-chocolatey-handsonlab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the source code for a hands on lab that was hosted at PuppetConf 2013 regarding the chocolatey provider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-licensed-issues"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-licensed-issues"&gt;chocolatey-licensed-issues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no source code in this repository.
Instead, this houses a list of issues that have been raised against the licensed versions of Chocolatey.
This gives a means of allowing people interested in issues raised with the licensed versions to follow when these issues have been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocobot-gitter"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocobot-gitter"&gt;chocobot-gitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the various Gitter rooms that exist for Chocolatey, for example the &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/chocolatey/choco"&gt;main one&lt;/a&gt;, there is a Hubot instance running.
This is really just a little bit of fun, as the Hubot instance doesn't actually have any automation capabilities.
This repository contains the source code for the Hubot instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-packages-recipes"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-recipes"&gt;chocolatey-packages-recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had to deal with a really hard application to package as a Chocolatey Package?
Or, have you ever been very happy with the outcome of a package that you created?
If so, and you are willing to share that work with others, this repository is a place to show them off.
At the time of writing, this repository houses examples of how to package Office 365 and Visual Studio 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="package-cleanup"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/package-cleanup"&gt;package-cleanup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository houses the source code for the package-cleanup windows service.
This is one of the automatic moderation processes that all packages submitted to chocolatey.org go through.
For more information on this, see the video further up in this blog post.
You would raise issues here if you find any problems with this service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-package-updater"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-package-updater"&gt;chocolatey-package-updater&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the shimgen repository, this repository houses an issues list for the chocolatey-package-updater tool.
This tool is closed source, but free to use for maintaining Chocolatey packages.
This is normally used when using the ketarin application to update packages.
&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, the recommended way to create automatically updating Chocolatey packages is to use &lt;a href="https://github.com/majkinetor/au"&gt;AU&lt;/a&gt;.
As a result, it is unlikely, unless you are already using ketarin, that you will need to use this repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey.github.com"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.github.com"&gt;chocolatey.github.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a deprecated repository, that no longer is used, and is kept around for reference only.
It used to house the source code for a documentation site for Chocolatey, however, this is replaced with the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/docs"&gt;docs site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-book"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-book"&gt;chocolatey-book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This repository hasn't really seen much traffic yet.
The idea was that this repository would house a walkthrough book on house to use Chocolatey.
If you are interested in helping with this effort, then definitely reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey.web"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey.web"&gt;chocolatey.web&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to making the decision to fork the NuGet Gallery to create the Chocolatey Community Repository, this repository was going to hold the source code for it.
Originally, FubuMVC was being considered as the basis for the Chocolatey Community Repository.
As you can see, it doesn't house much and is probably something we should move into an archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-environments"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-environments"&gt;chocolatey-environments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonably new repository.
The intention is that this will house example vagrant environments that can be used to test out the various parts of Chocolatey.
The first example environment in this repository shows you how to setup a system for automated package internalization in your own environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nuget.server-chocolatey"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/NuGet.Server-chocolatey"&gt;NuGet.Server-chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple Server actually needs this repository for building up the binaries that it uses.
This is a Chocolatey-specific fork to add enhancements to that repository so they can be used with Chocolatey Simple Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocobot-slack"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocobot-slack"&gt;chocobot-slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is similar to the chocobot-gitter repository.
The only difference being that this Hubot instance is for Slack, rather than Gitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cla-assistant"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/cla-assistant"&gt;cla-assistant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure that everyone that contributes to Chocolatey has signed the CLA that we have in place, we run this CLA assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-webhooks"&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-webhooks"&gt;chocolatey-webhooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;chocolatey-webhooks acts as a relay from GitHub and other services to Jira and Trello, so that events on a Github project automatically create and update Jira issues or Trello cards.
This is a work in progress repository, and isn't currently actively being used.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>2018 - A Retrospective</title>
		<updated>2019-01-01T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I always thought it was a cliché to hear people say that &lt;code&gt;the year has passed SO quickly&lt;/code&gt;, but this year, I got to witness this first hand.  2018 passed VERY quickly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/The-Girls.png" class="img-fluid" alt="The Girls" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to believe that our eldest child is away to Primary School and our youngest is almost 2!  Where has this time gone!?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best side effects of now working from home is that I get to spend more time with these two incredible children, including doing things like the school drop offs, etc, things that I would never have been able to do in previous job.  I am very thankful for getting to spend more time with these two, as well as obviously my wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="looking-back-on-2018"&gt;Looking back on 2018&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2018 as been a VERY busy year, in which there have been some highs, and some lows (there were two deaths in our family this year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2017-a-retrospective"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that I did last year, this post is a brief recap, in no particular order, of some of the highlights of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="started-working-at-chocolatey"&gt;Started working at Chocolatey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, I started &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/and-so-the-adventure-begins"&gt;working for Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; full time.  This was a huge step for me, and I am very happy to say that it has been going very well, and I am excited to see what 2019 has in store for us all.  Throughout 2018, the Chocolatey Team has expanded, and it is looking set to expand further in 2019.  Some very exciting times ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of starting to work from home, this saw a conversation of half of our garage from this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Office.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Office Before" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;into this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Office1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Office After" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Office2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Office After" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a busy year for Chocolatey, starting off with me travelling to Kansas to spend a week with Rob, as an introduction.  Since then we have been busy working on new releases across all Chocolatey components, with my main focus being on Chocolatey Central Management, which is now available in beta for customers to trial out.  In addition, we released a new version of &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/chocolatey-gui-v0.16.0-released"&gt;Chocolatey GUI&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="speaking-tour"&gt;Speaking Tour&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in January, and going into February, I went &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2018-speaking-tour"&gt;on the road&lt;/a&gt; and presented at a number of .Net User Groups.  This included talks on both Chocolatey and Cake.  This was my first time doing anything like this, but I had such a good time, that I am planning on doing the same thing in 2019.  Stay tuned for more information on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="powershell-summit"&gt;PowerShell Summit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had heard a lot of good things about the PowerShell Summit, and I am happy to say that I wasn't disappointed.  This was a great event!  It was a chance to meet a lot of people from the community, far too many to mention here.  If you are on the fence about attending this event in 2019, I would definitely suggest that you jump at the chance while there are still tickets available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolatey was a sponsor at this event:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/PowerShellSummit-Sponsor.png" class="img-fluid" alt="PowerShell Summit Sponsor" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and it was a great opportunity to speak to people who are currently using Chocolatey, and also to introduce it to people who are not yet using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was on this trip that I saw one of the most bizarre things I have ever seen...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/PowerShellSummit-BubbleGum.png" class="img-fluid" alt="PowerShell Summit Bubble Gum Wall" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that is actually an entire wall covered in bubble gum.  The smell in that alley was crazy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="trip-to-sweden"&gt;Trip to Sweden&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, I made a trip to the DevOps Usergroup Gothenburg to visit my friend &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devlead"&gt;Mattias Karlsson&lt;/a&gt; and present a talk on Chocolatey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Dough-Sign.png" class="img-fluid" alt="DOUGH Sign" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had never been to Sweden before, and I thoroughly enjoyed this trip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="that-conference"&gt;That Conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line... this was a great event, and I would thoroughly recommend anyone attending it.  Everything about the conference was well organised, and the talks were very high quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this event, I helped run a Chocolatey Workshop along with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder"&gt;Rob Reynolds&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/ThatConference-Workshop.png" class="img-fluid" alt="That Conference Workshop" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the highlights of the event had to be the bacon covered in chocolate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/ThatConference-ChocolateyBacon.png" class="img-fluid" alt="That Conference Chocolate Bacon" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-fest-and-puppetize-live"&gt;Chocolatey Fest and Puppetize Live&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My fourth trip to the States in 2018 was to attend the inaugural &lt;a href="https://chocolateyfest.com/"&gt;Chocolatey Fest&lt;/a&gt; Conference and Puppetize Live events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/ChocolateyFest-Registration.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Fest Registration" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feedback from the event was very positive, so all the hard work that went into the organistaion was definitely worth it.  There was even some signature Chocolatey coins:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/ChocolateyFest-Coin.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Fest Coin" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this event was also the first run of a &lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/chocolatey-internalizer-workshop"&gt;Chocolatey Workshop&lt;/a&gt; that myself and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pauby"&gt;Paul Broadwith&lt;/a&gt; were doing.  This focused on how you can use Chocolatey internally within your Organisation, and ensure consistent and reliable installations by internalizing packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="winops-conf"&gt;WinOps Conf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my fourth year attending the WinOps Conference (this is getting to be a habit), and once again, it didn't disappoint.  Lots of conversations were had, and the talks that I attended were of a very high standard.  This year was slightly different in that I was presenting a &lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/chocolatey-internalizer-workshop"&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pauby"&gt;Paul Broadwith&lt;/a&gt;.  This was our second time doing this workshop, and we incorporated a number of feedback points from our first outing, and I think it was a lot better this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolatey also had a booth at the event, where we were able to talk to lots of people interested in using Chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/WinOps-Chocolatey.png" class="img-fluid" alt="WinOps Chocolatey" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="microsoft-mvp"&gt;Microsoft MVP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, I was very happy to be informed that I was being renewed as a Microsoft MVP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/MVP-Profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="MVP Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, this wasn't something that I was expecting, and I was very excited to get the email letting me know.  In August, the MVP Package arrived in the post, and I was able to add to my main MVP award:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/MVP-Award.png" class="img-fluid" alt="MVP Award" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought the instructions on how to do this were very useful:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/MVP-Instructions.png" class="img-fluid" alt="MVP Instructions" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the alternative version on Twitter was also very funny!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MVPAward?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;&amp;#64;MVPAward&lt;/a&gt;, I just had to do this. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kTiwoqYIO3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kTiwoqYIO3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; diederik krols (&amp;#64;diederikkrols) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/diederikkrols/status/1018059116596613120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also very happy to be attending the MVP Summit in March.  I wasn't able to attend this in 2018 due to other commitments, and I heard from other MVP's that I know that it was very good, so excited about attending in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="open-source-contributions"&gt;Open Source Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I am very happy to say that I shipped quite a few things (some which have been on the back burner for a while, and others that are brand new).  These included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/introducing-cake.eazfuscator.net-addin"&gt;Cake.Eazfuscator.Net Addin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/introducing-cake.discord-addin"&gt;Cake.Discord Addin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/introducing-cake.dotnettool.module"&gt;Cake.DotNetTool.Module&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/introducing-chocolatey-vscode-extension"&gt;Chocolatey VS Code Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/introducing-chocolatey-azure-devops-extension"&gt;Chocolatey Azure DevOps Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/introducing-ci-cd-assets-repository-and-vscode-extension"&gt;CI/CD Assets VS Code Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/introducing-cake-recipe-vscode-extension"&gt;Cake.Recipe VS Code Extension&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/gitreleasemanager-release-0.8.0"&gt;GitReleaseManager 0.8.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, I also got access to the &lt;a href="https://developer.github.com/actions/"&gt;GitHub Actions Beta&lt;/a&gt;, and I was able to create an &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/getting-started-with-github-actions"&gt;action specifically for Cake&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to run a Cake script as a result of an action on your repository.  I showed an example of how you could &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/using-cake-github-action"&gt;send out a Tweet&lt;/a&gt;, based on a milestone being closed on your repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seem to be on a little bit of a run of creating Visual Studio Code extensions.  They are very easy to create, and can be as complicated or simple as you want.  I have at least one more idea for another extension that I am going to try to find time for in 2019.  In terms of download numbers for the extensions, these can be seen here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Visual-Studio-Marketplace.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Visual Studio Marketplace" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was secretly hoping to get to 3000 downloads for the Chocolatey VS Code Extension, but didn't quite get there in 2018, but hopefully this year!  I am very happy with the download number for the Chocolatey Azure DevOps Extension.  This was an &amp;quot;itch&amp;quot; that I had been wanting to scratch for a while to get a fully working Chocolatey implementation for Azure DevOps, and I was very happy to get it released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cake"&gt;Cake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cake continued to go from strength to strength in 2018.  With 11 releases, which included the release of a &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cake.Tool/"&gt;.Net Global Tool version of Cake&lt;/a&gt;, there was plenty of things to be excited about.  Since releasing this in August, it has been downloaded over 100000 times.  There are now also official &lt;a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/cakebuild/cake"&gt;Docker images available for Cake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cake-Contrib Organisation continued to grow as well, now with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50 People now a member of the Organisation on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;129 Repositories now in the Organisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;238 Packages associated with the cake-contrib user on NuGet.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6,994,682 downloads of addins and modules associated with the cake-contrib user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nuget-profile"&gt;NuGet Profile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a growing number of NuGet packages, and associated total download count:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/NuGet-Profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="NuGet Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="chocolatey-profile"&gt;Chocolatey Profile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of downloads of Chocolatey packages that I help maintain has continued to grow this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Chocolatey-Profile.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-contributions"&gt;GitHub Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to last year, my GitHub Contributions are less this year (2423 compared to 3513)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/GitHub-Contributions-2018.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Contributions 2018" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in part, this was a conscious decision on my part.  In hindsight, I sort of got carried away last year, trying to obtain a perfect streak of GitHub Contributions.  This year, this was far from a goal, and instead, I opted to close the laptop and concentrate on other things.  I still like to think I made a difference with the contributions that were made.  More on this in other sections of this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hacktoberfest"&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing the yearly tradition, I took part in Hacktoberfest, and was able to complete the event, which resulted in me obtaining some very cool swag:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Hacktoberfest-Swag.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hacktoberfest Swag" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition this year, Microsoft got in on the act, and provided an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleymcnamara"&gt;Ashley McNamara&lt;/a&gt; original t-shirt for a contribution in to a Microsoft GitHb Repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Hacktoberfest-Microsoft-Swag.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hacktoberfest Microsoft Swag" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I witnessed first hand the darker side of Hacktoberfest.  This is where people contribute spam pull Requests to Open Source projects in order to obtain the free swag.  This puts an unnecessary burden on Open Source Maintainers, and it is a sad side effect of the event.  In an email from DigitalOcean after the event they stated that they are going to try to address this ahead of the next event, and I hope that they are able to do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of our local User Group, we ran a &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Aberdeen-Developers-NET-User-Group/events/254881639/"&gt;Hacktoberfest event&lt;/a&gt; to introduce people to the event, and also to how to make contributions to Open Source Projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pull-requests"&gt;24 Pull Requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Hacktoberfest, I once again took part on the 24 Pull Requests event, and successfully completed it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/24PullRequests-Complete.png" class="img-fluid" alt="24 Pull Requests Complete" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also manned the Gitter Room for the event similar to last year to address any questions that came up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One slight difference in the event this year was that it wasn't just contributions in the form of pull requests that were accepted.  You were also able to manually contribute other contributions such as reviewing pull requests, asnwering Stack Overflow questions, speaking at User Group events, etc.  All of this was in order to try to make 24 Pull Requests more inclusive to everyone.  There is more detail on this in the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/&amp;#64;teabass/making-24-pull-requests-more-inclusive-for-2018-a64a1476335e"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stack-overflow-contributions"&gt;Stack Overflow Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing on from last year, I continued to answer questions on Stack Overflow related to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitFlow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, my reputation increased to 7086 (an increase of 2289).  Somewhat surprisingly to me, this put me into the top 2% overall on Stack Overflow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Stack-Overflow-Reputation.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Reputation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also saw an increase in the numbers of badges that I have been awarded:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Stack-Overflow-Badges-Hat.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Badges" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 Gold&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Silver&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;4 Bronze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my impact increased to (an increase of 106k):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Stack-Overflow-Impact.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Impact" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="youtube-videos"&gt;YouTube Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made a concerted effort in 2018 to make more YouTube videos, and this resulted in quite a few new playlists being created.  These centred mainly on releases for the various Open Source Projects that I work on, but also showcasing some specific features on those tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/YouTube-Channel.png" class="img-fluid" alt="YouTube Channel" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One major change in the most recent videos that I have created is that I have started appearing in the videos.  This was a big step for me, as I am not particurlay confident in this area, but I &amp;quot;think&amp;quot; they work.  In order to make this happen, I have purchased a green screen, and use the &lt;a href="https://obsproject.com/"&gt;OBS&lt;/a&gt; software to apply a chroma filter to the camera input so that I can &amp;quot;float&amp;quot; above the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="twitch"&gt;Twitch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I thougth that putting myself into my YouTube videos was a big step, you can only imagine how scary it was to start doing live streams on Twitch, but I did it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Twitch-Profile.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Twitch Profile" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have done two live streams, focusing on Chocolatey, and I have plans for continuing more in 2019, as well as focusing on other technologies such as Cake.  If you are interested in following along, you can join my stream &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gep13"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aberdeen-developers"&gt;Aberdeen Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers continued to host events in 2018 (mainly thanks to the work of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nyami"&gt;Douglas Cameron&lt;/a&gt;) but I helped out where I could.  This year, we hosted events on Azure Functions and Cosmos DB, Blockchain, and Artificial Intelligence.  In addition, we started what is being referred to as &lt;code&gt;.NET and Natter&lt;/code&gt; events, which are much more informal events without a speaker, but more of a chance for people to get to together to talk about things that interest them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, we ran a &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/aberdeen-developers-net-user-group"&gt;gofundme&lt;/a&gt; campaign with the aim to raise money for purchasing equipment to allow us to record, and potentially stream, our meetups.  I am very happy to say that we succeeded in meeting our funding target, and the equipment has now been purchased.  Now we simply need to figure out how to make it all work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to the .NET Foundation, we were able to start using &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Aberdeen-Developers-NET-User-Group/"&gt;meetup.com&lt;/a&gt; for hosting/advertising the events that we run.  This has turned out to be very successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="office-hours"&gt;Office Hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, I kept my &lt;a href="https://officehours.io/people/gep13"&gt;officehours.io&lt;/a&gt; profile open, and as a result, I had 3 very interesting conversations with people on various topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2019/01/01/Office-Hours.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Office Hours" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of officehours.io takes a little bit of getting used to, but once you &amp;quot;grok&amp;quot; it, I think it is a very useful medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in talking to me, feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thats-a-wrap"&gt;That's a wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that, as they say, is that!  Once again, this year has FLOWN by, but it has been a very enjoyable year, and I am looking forward to more in 2019!  I hope 2018 was good to everyone!&lt;/p&gt;
</content>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;When I was growing up, I always thought it was a cliché to hear people say that &lt;code&gt;the year has passed SO quickly&lt;/code&gt;, but this year, I got to witness this first hand.  2018 passed VERY quickly!&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>GitReleaseManager Release 0.8.0</title>
		<updated>2018-12-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce the 0.8.0 Release of the &lt;a href="https://github.com/GitTools/GitReleaseManager"&gt;GitReleaseManager&lt;/a&gt;.  This is an important release as it brings with it a .Net Global Tool version of the tool.  Now, you can install it using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;dotnet tool install GitReleaseManager.Tool -g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id="installation"&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now install GitReleaseManager on Windows as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/12/30/GitReleaseManager-Windows-Install.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitReleaseManager Windows Install" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also on Mac as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/12/30/GitReleaseManager-Mac-Install.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitReleaseManager Mac Install" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, it is still possible to install GitReleaseManager using Chocolatey with the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;choco install gitreleasemanager.portable
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;h1 id="update-labels"&gt;Update Labels&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the .Net Global Tool, another feature was added to GitReleaseManager.  It is now possible to update a GitHub Repository with a pre-defined set of labels.  In this release, that pre-defined list is hard-coded into GitReleaseManager, however, in a future release, it will be possible to provide a file with the labels to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="why-is-this-needed"&gt;Why is this needed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a new GitHub repository comes with a set of existing labels:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/12/30/GitHub-Default-Labels.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Default Labels" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are not quite to my liking, and everytime I created a new Repository, I found I had to change them.  This ultimately resulted in a script which I would run to change them.  I then decided that this would make a sensible addition to GitReleaseManager.  As a result, you can now run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-shell"&gt;gitreleasemanager.exe label -o cake-contrib -r Cake.Twitter -u bob -p password
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To update the set of labels on the repository to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/12/30/GitReleaseManager-Labels.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitReleaseManager Labels" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a destructive operation, in the sense that it will delete all the existing labels on your repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="thanks"&gt;Thanks&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say a huge thank you to Artur (&lt;a href="https://github.com/arturcic"&gt;&amp;#64;arturcic&lt;/a&gt;) who worked on this release, and who was responsible for the creation of the .Net Global Tool.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="release-information"&gt;Release Information&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Release notes for all GitReleaseManager releases can be found on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/GitTools/GitReleaseManager/releases"&gt;GitHub Repository Release Page&lt;/a&gt; but the specific additions for the 0.8.0 release are shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
