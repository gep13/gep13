		<title>MVP and RD Wall at Microsoft Ignite</title>
		<updated>2018-09-30T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Last week there was a flurry of pictures on Twitter and Facebook from the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite"&gt;Microsoft Ignite&lt;/a&gt; Conference, and one in particular caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="mvp-and-rd-wall"&gt;MVP and RD Wall&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was this picture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/09/30/mvp_rd_wall.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="MVP and RD Wall" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Full credit to Joel Lindström on Facebook for this photo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was pointed out to me on Twitter by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/punker76/status/1044343384503209988"&gt;Jan Karger&lt;/a&gt; that my name was included in the wall.  A quick check, and indeed I could see my name:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/09/30/gep13_mvp_rd_wall.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="My name on the wall" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no idea that Microsoft did this, and I really think it is a nice touch, to show appreciation to all the MVP's and Regional Directors.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Hacktoberfest Meetup 2018</title>
		<updated>2018-09-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Aberdeen Developers .Net User Group are proud to be hosting a Hacktoberfest event on the 4th October 2018.  Full details of the event can be found on the &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Aberdeen-Developers-NET-User-Group/events/254881639/"&gt;Meetup page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/f/6/6/highres_474768998.jpeg" class="img-fluid" alt="Hacktoberfest" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-is-hacktoberfest"&gt;What is Hacktoberfest?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 4 years, DigitalOcean (in conjunction with GitHub) have been running an event called Hacktoberfest. It is a month long event where you are encouraged to contribute to Open Source Projects (hosted on GitHub) and in return you get some cool swag (typically a t-shirt and some stickers). All you have to do is submit 5 pull requests to projects on GitHub during the month of October. Registration for the event is completely free. More information on this event can be found here: &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/"&gt;https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have personally taken part in this event for the last three years, and I can vouch for the quality of the swag that you can get your hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="ok-so-what-do-i-get-out-of-it"&gt;Ok, so what do I get out of it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up, you will need to &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/"&gt;register&lt;/a&gt; to indicate that you are going to be participating in the event.  If you open up five pull requests between October 1 and October 31, you will get a free, limited edition Hacktoberfest t-shirt. &lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; These pull requests do not need to be merged in order to be counted.  They just need to be opened during the time frame of the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you needed any further encouragement, you also have the ability to grab a free limited edition Microsoft t-shirt, which has been designed by &lt;a href="https://github.com/ashleymcnamara"&gt;Ashley McNamara&lt;/a&gt;.  This was announced by Microsoft in this &lt;a href="https://open.microsoft.com/2018/09/18/hacktoberfest-2018-microsoft/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.  The rule for this t-shirt is simply to open a single pull request in one of the MANY open source repositories that Microsoft have.  A full list of these can be found in the linked blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-is-going-to-happen-at-the-event"&gt;What is going to happen at the event?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is going to start with me doing a very brief introduction to contributing to Open Source.  This is something I have been involved in for almost 7 years now, and I am now actually working for a company based on the creation of Open Source software, so I have some great, and not so great, stories to tell about it.  We will walk through the basics of doing your first pull request, and answer any questions you might have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that out of the way, we will then jump straight into contributing to Open Source projects.  If you have a particular project in mind that's great.  If not, I can point you in the direction of some projects that I know need some help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-do-i-sign-up-for-the-event"&gt;How do I sign up for the event?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply visit the &lt;a href="https://www.meetup.com/Aberdeen-Developers-NET-User-Group/events/254881639/"&gt;Meetup page&lt;/a&gt;, and indicate that you will be attending.  The number of registrations for this event is smaller than normal, but this is due to the space that we have access to.  So I would ask that you only attend the event if you have every intention of completing the Hacktoberfest event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-should-i-bring-with-me"&gt;What should I bring with me?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that you are going to need in order to participate in this event is yourself, your laptop, and some ideas about the Open Source Projects that you would like to contribute to.  Drinks and some snacks will be being provided by &lt;a href="https://www.codify.ltd.uk/"&gt;Codify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully see you there, and feel free to reach out with any questions you might have.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Problem Running Chocolatey Test Environment</title>
		<updated>2018-07-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;During a &lt;a href="https://gitter.im/chocolatey/choco?at=5b59cf471be9bb57bcc5a6e4"&gt;Gitter discussion&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, an interesting
point of discussion came up, so I thought I would capture it here in a blog post.  The short version is that you
probably want to make sure that you are using the latest version of Vagrant when trying to use the Chocolatey Test
Environment, although bear in mind that this might not have been tested by anyone, and may have other problems :-).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The Problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Chocolatey Community member was trying to run the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-test-environment"&gt;Chocolatey Test Environment&lt;/a&gt;]
on his Windows 10 machine, they were running into the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
 ==&amp;gt; default: Box 'ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...
    default: Box Provider: virtualbox
    default: Box Version: &amp;gt;= 0
The box 'ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm' could not be found or
could not be accessed in the remote catalog. If this is a private
box on HashiCorp's Atlas, please verify you're logged in via
`vagrant login`. Also, please double-check the name. The expanded
URL and error message are shown below:

URL: [&amp;quot;https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm&amp;quot;]
Error: The requested URL returned error: 404 Not Found
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going to the URL shown in the output above, it did indeed result in a 404.  However, a quick
search of the Vagrant Cloud showed that the base box did in fact exist.  You can find it here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://app.vagrantup.com/ferventcoder/boxes/win2012r2-x64-nocm"&gt;https://app.vagrantup.com/ferventcoder/boxes/win2012r2-x64-nocm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A further test on my own machine, resulted in the following output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==&amp;gt; default: Box 'ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...
default: Box Provider: virtualbox
default: Box Version: &amp;gt;= 0
==&amp;gt; default: Loading metadata for box 'ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm'
default: URL: https://vagrantcloud.com/ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm
==&amp;gt; default: Adding box 'ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm' (v1.0.0) for provider: virtualbox
default: Downloading: https://vagrantcloud.com/ferventcoder/boxes/win2012r2-x64-nocm/versions/1.0.0/providers/virtualbox.box
default: Progress: 1% (Rate: 2764k/s, Estimated time remaining: 0:30:03)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which correctly worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The difference in the download URL's.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm"&gt;https://atlas.hashicorp.com/ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compared to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://vagrantcloud.com/ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm"&gt;https://vagrantcloud.com/ferventcoder/win2012r2-x64-nocm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;The Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit of digging, it turns out that the Chocolatey Community Member was following the
instructions in the README.md of the linked repository, which suggests using 1.8.1 of vagrant,
where as I was using version 2.0.1.  My guess was that there was &amp;quot;something&amp;quot; in the earlier
version of the vagrant client which no longer worked, i.e. a URL redirect was no longer in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out that this &amp;quot;guess&amp;quot; was pretty much spot on.  Rob Reynolds was able to confirm this by
pointing out this Google Groups post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/vagrant-up/H8C68UTkosU/qz4YUmAgBAAJ"&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/vagrant-up/H8C68UTkosU/qz4YUmAgBAAJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bascially, if you are wanting to run an earlier version of the Vagrant client, you are going
to need to set the following environment variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-sh"&gt;# macOS and Linux
export VAGRANT_SERVER_URL=&amp;quot;https://vagrantcloud.com&amp;quot;

# Windows (CMD)
set VAGRANT_SERVER_URL=&amp;quot;https://vagrantcloud.com&amp;quot;

# Windows (Powershell)
$env:VAGRANT_SERVER_URL=&amp;quot;https://vagrantcloud.com&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or, upgrade to a newer version of Vagrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-outcome"&gt;The Outcome&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am going to update the Chocolatey Test Environment repository to include some of this
information, so that other people don't also run into this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Are you coming to Chocolatey Fest?</title>
		<updated>2018-07-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;When I joined Chocolatey, I knew I was going to be in for an exciting ride, and so far, I have not been disappointed.  To date, I have been able to work on some exciting new features that are due out later this year, and I attended the PowerShell Summit, and interacted directly with people using Chocolatey.  Looking forward, the thing I am most looking forward to in 2018 is &lt;a href="https://chocolateyfest.com/"&gt;Chocolatey Fest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-is-chocolatey-fest"&gt;What is Chocolatey Fest?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolatey Fest is the first ever independent conference in North America focused exclusively on Windows Automation (WinOps).  It is a one day event, which is going to be hosted at the Park Central Hotel in San Francisco, on the 8th October 2018.  I am planning on travelling to attend this event, and I very much looking forward to hearing about how people are using Chocolatey personally and in their Organisations, as well as the larger picture about Windows Automation.  I have a feeling that this is going to be a great event, and I would encourage you if you are in the area, to come along and join in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested in attending, you can find the registration page &lt;a href="https://chocolateyfest.com/register"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Will yours be the Golden Ticket?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="will-willy-wonka-make-an-appearance"&gt;Will Willy Wonka make an appearance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You never know who you might see at the event:&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to get console output from a WPF application</title>
		<updated>2018-07-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;While implementing a recent feature addition to &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI/pull/613"&gt;Chocolatey GUI&lt;/a&gt;, I stumbled across something that I thought was blog worthy, so I thought I would add some notes here for future me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chocolatey GUI is a WPF application, but the feature that was being added here was the ability to execute Chocolatey GUI from the command line in order to enable/disable features within the application.  i.e. you will be able to run commands like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-powershell"&gt;chocolateygui feature enable -n=&amp;lt;featureName&amp;gt;
chocolateygui feature disable -n=&amp;lt;featureName&amp;gt;
chocolateygui feature list
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started writing this feature, I thought that this was going to be simple.  What I didn't know is that when compiled with an &lt;code&gt;OutputType&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;WinExe&lt;/code&gt;, which a WPF application is, it doesn't output anything to the console.  As a result, trying to do something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;Console.Write(&amp;quot;This is a test&amp;quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;results in nothing happening.  There are also no errors at runtime, so it is not immediately clear what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, after searching around, it was clear that I wasn't the first person to stumble into this.  There are a number of different solutions out there (including attempting to attach to the existing console, creating a new console, etc.), however, none of them felt quite right until I found this article:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.rsuter.com/write-application-can-act-console-application-wpf-gui-application/"&gt;https://blog.rsuter.com/write-application-can-act-console-application-wpf-gui-application/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to Rico Suter for this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magic sauce that makes this work is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;    [DllImport(&amp;quot;kernel32.dll&amp;quot;, SetLastError = true, ExactSpelling = true)]
    static extern bool FreeConsole();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pinvoke call is completely opposite to how I was originally thinking about it.  Rather than attempting to attach to an existing console, or create a new one, this technique starts out assuming that there is a console, and if that console isn't required, get rid of it.  i.e. &lt;code&gt;FreeConsole&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order for this to work, it is necessary to change the output type of you WPF project to be a Console Application, and also add an &lt;code&gt;InitialzeComponent()&lt;/code&gt; call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Chocolatey GUI, the startup code then looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-csharp"&gt;        public App()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        internal static SplashScreen SplashScreen { get; set; }

        [STAThread]
        public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            if (args.Length != 0)
            {
                // Run as Console Application
                ParseArgumentsAndRunCommand(args);
            }
            else
            {
                // Run as WPF Application
                FreeConsole();

                // Do Stuff
            }
        }

        [DllImport(&amp;quot;kernel32.dll&amp;quot;, SetLastError = true, ExactSpelling = true)]
        private static extern bool FreeConsole();

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/ChocolateyGUI/pull/613"&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; to Chocolatey GUI for the complete implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

		<id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/chocolatey-gui-v0.16.0-released</id>
		<title>Chocolatey GUI v0.16.0 released</title>
		<updated>2018-02-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h3 id="get-it-while-its-hot"&gt;Get it while it's hot!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the latest release of Chocolatey GUI, version 0.16.0, in the useful &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/ChocolateyGUI"&gt;place&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you already have it installed, then simply do &lt;code&gt;choco upgrade chocolateygui&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="so-whats-new"&gt;So what's new?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest addition to this release of Chocolatey GUI is the tile view.  You can now view packages in a tile format, which shows the icon of the underlying application, if there is one.  You can see an example of this here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/02/15/chocolatey_gui_tile_view.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey GUI Tile View" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has been a much sought after feature, so we are very happy to have this finally land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other biggest feature in this release in the increased amount of languages that are supported by Chocolatey GUI.  The supported languages now include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;French&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Norwegian&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portuguese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dutch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;German&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swedish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japanese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spanish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you has to go out to everyone who has joined the &lt;a href="https://www.transifex.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-gui/dashboard/"&gt;Transifex&lt;/a&gt; team to make this happen.  If you are interested in helping out in translating Chocolatey GUI into another language, then please reach out, and we can get that included in the next release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="release-notes"&gt;Release Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

		<title>And so the adventure begins...</title>
		<updated>2018-01-28T00:00:00Z</updated>

&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2017-a-retrospective"&gt;2017 retrospective blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I mentioned that there was going to be some amazing news at the end of January.  Well, now it is time to announce that news...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i-am-joining-chocolatey-software-inc"&gt;I am joining Chocolatey Software, Inc.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/28/logo_long.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Chocolatey" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's right!  I am joining &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder"&gt;Rob Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt; team, delivering the best package manager for Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of you reading this blog will know, I have been a long time contributor to the Chocolatey project.  In actual fact, my first foray into the world of Open Source Software was a &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; into the original Chocolatey GitHub repository.  Since that pull request, I have worked on various parts of the Chocolatey Project including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answering questions on GitHub, Stack Overflow and Gitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming a moderator of packages which are pushed to chocolatey.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speaking about Chocolatey at local User Group events&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping triage and fixing issues with the core Chocolatey project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintaining and contributing to the Chocolatey GUI project&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contributing to the package validator and verifier projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In August 2015 I was invited to join the Chocolatey Organisation on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the time that I have been contributing, I have watched with pride as Chocolatey has grown in popularity, and also how it has expanded into the commercial side of things, by offering licensed versions that contain additional features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was around the middle of 2017 that I was approached to join this Chocolately adventure, and after some discussion with family and friends, I decided that it really was too good an offer to pass up.  I am very excited about getting started contributing to Chocolatey in this new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about my new role, or Chocolatey in general, then please feel to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>2018 Speaking Tour</title>
		<updated>2018-01-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h2 id="going-on-the-road"&gt;Going on the road&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting in January, and I am going to be doing something that I have never done before...  Visting a number of User Groups around the world doing talks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have done the odd talk here and there over the years, but this tour will see me hitting 6 different venues in just under 2 weeks.  As you might well imagine, I am really looking forward to this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following are the list of places that you can find me, along with some stickers to give away!  (Who doesn't like stickers!)&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>2017 - A Retrospective</title>
		<updated>2018-01-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h2 id="looking-back-on-2017"&gt;Looking back on 2017&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, 2017 has been an amazing year, with lots of stuff happening both from a personal stand point, as well as other stuff.  It has also been a very sad year with the passing of both my Granny and my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/2016-a-retrospective"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; that I did last year, this post is a brief recap, in no particular order, of some of the highlights of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="baby-park-2"&gt;Baby Park #2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the 17th February, we welcomed our second child, &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/amelia-mabel-park"&gt;Amelia Mabel Park&lt;/a&gt; into the world.  To say that the last 10 months have just flown by would be an understatement.  My wife and I have had so much fun watching Amelia grow and form her own little personality.  Alivia has taken to being a big sister very well, and she loves her little sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/10/alivia-and-amelia.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Alivia and Amelia" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="microsoft-mvp"&gt;Microsoft MVP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, I was awarded the &lt;a href="https://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/i-am-a-microsoft-mvp"&gt;Microsoft MVP Award&lt;/a&gt;.  Although I knew I had been nominated for this award, it still came as a very nice surprise to actually be awarded.  Unfortunately, I am not able to make it to the MVP Summit in 2018. I'm obviously hoping to be renewed again next year so that I can make it along to the Summit, as I have heard that it is a very good experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="github-contributions"&gt;GitHub Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following on from 2016's increased level of contributions to GitHub, I sort of got onto a little bit of a run in 2017, and once I got started, I didn't want to stop!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/10/GitHub-Contributions-2017.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Contributions for 2017" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple months into the streak, I started wondering whether it would be possible to keep up the contributions for the entire year, and the rest as they say is history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eagle eyed amongst you might notice that there is a blip on the 2nd March.  To be honest, I am not sure what happened here, as I did have a contribution on this day.  Shrug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/10/GitHub-Contribution-Blip.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub Contribution Blip" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="podcasts"&gt;Podcasts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I was invited to appear on two podcasts.  The first was my second appearance on the &lt;a href="https://cynicaldeveloper.com/podcast/36/"&gt;Cynical Developer podcast&lt;/a&gt; where I got to talk about all things &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;.  And the second was an appearance on the &lt;a href="http://www.gonemobile.io/58"&gt;Gone Mobile&lt;/a&gt; podcast, where myself and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devlead"&gt;Mattias&lt;/a&gt; talked about all things Cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="talks"&gt;Talks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of Amelia in the first part of the year, my ability to attend conferences this year wasn't the same as last year.  As a result, I was only able to submit and speak at 2 conferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first was at &lt;a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com"&gt;DDD Reading&lt;/a&gt; where I did a talk entitled &amp;quot;Control your GitHub releases with GitVersion and GitReleaseManager&amp;quot;, where I talked about two tools that I use on almost all the Open Source Projects that I work on.  I also presented the same talk at &lt;a href="https://www.dddeastanglia.com"&gt;DDD East Anglia&lt;/a&gt;.  If you are interested in checking out this talk you can find a recording of it on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/SlM02V1tkSc"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018 I plan on doing a lot more talks. In fact, I already have 6 speaking engagements lined up.  I will have a follow-up blog post with links to where I will be speaking in case you are able to make it along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hacktoberfest"&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In what is now turning into a yearly tradition, I once again took part in &lt;a href="https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/"&gt;Hacktoberfest&lt;/a&gt;.  If you haven't heard about this event, I strongly encourage you to check it out.  All it takes is 4 pull requests in the month of October. It is a great bit of fun and at the end of it, you get some quality swag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here is the swag I mentioned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/11/hacktoberfest-2017-swag.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Hacktoberfest 2017 Swag" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pull-requests"&gt;24 Pull Requests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there is no swag involved in this contest, it is still great fun, and once again I encourage everyone to take part in &lt;a href="https://24pullrequests.com/"&gt;24 Pull Requests&lt;/a&gt;.  It is a great way to get involved in Open Source, and give back something to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was slightly different from last year because &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/teabass"&gt;Andrew&lt;/a&gt; invited me to join the 24 Pull Requests GitHub Organisation.  This was mainly due to me hanging out in the Gitter Chat Room and helping out where I could when questions were being asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="stack-overflow-contributions"&gt;Stack Overflow Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, I made a committed effort to answer more questions on Stack Overflow, focusing on questions surrounding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GitFlow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All topics which are important to me, and which I think I am capable of answering questions on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Reputation on Stack Overflow increased to 4797 (an increase on 2074):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/10/Reputation%20-%202018-01-03_14-24-06.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Reputation" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also increased the number of badges which I have earned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/10/Badges%20-%202018-01-03_14-24-56.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Badges" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including the &lt;code&gt;Fanatic&lt;/code&gt; badge (which meant visiting the site on 100 consecutive days), which sort of went hand in hand with my GitHub Contribution streak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And according to the site, I have reached 87 thousand people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/10/Impact%20-%202018-01-03_14-25-28.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Stack Overflow Impact" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="youtube-videos"&gt;YouTube Videos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017 I ventured into an area which I had never been before, namely creating and publishing videos to YouTube.  This really came about after watching the work that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley"&gt;Geoffrey Huntley&lt;/a&gt; was doing, and I wanted to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find my YouTube Channel &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GaryEwanPark"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have created some videos on AppVeyor and Cake (mainly around releases of the VSCode Extension for Cake), but I am planning on expanding to include some more topics this year.  So be sure to subscribe to my channel to catch the new videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="winops-conf-2017-and-powershell-dev-day"&gt;WinOps Conf 2017 and PowerShell Dev Day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my third year in a row attending the WinOps Conf, and I am happy to say that it didn't disappoint.  Once again it was a great event, thank you to all the organisers and helpers for making it a great day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year was a slightly different experience, since I was helping out at the other side of the fence.  I was there representing Chocolatey, who were both a sponsor of the event, as well as doing a Full Day Workshop and Presentation.  This was the first time that I was able to meet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder"&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt; in person!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had loads of great conversations across the two days, and it was great to see the excitement that people have for Chocolatey!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was me chatting with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevenmurawski"&gt;Steve Murawski&lt;/a&gt; at the Chocolatey booth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2018/01/11/winops-steve-murawski.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Chatting with Steve Murawski" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in London, I was also able to attend the &lt;a href="https://psday.uk/"&gt;PowerShell Dev Day&lt;/a&gt;, which was also a great event.  I would encourage anyone to go to this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tretton37-knowabunga"&gt;tretton37 Knowabunga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was quite simply an AMAZING event!  For those of you that haven't heard of this before, you can find some information &lt;a href="http://thecodejunkie.com/2014/02/12/creating-value-by-sharing-knowledge/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://tretton37.com/blog/knowabunga-day-june"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the story goes like this...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the blue, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thecodejunkie"&gt;Andreas&lt;/a&gt; asked me if I wanted an all expenses paid trip to Sweden, to spend the day representing Cake at their all day Open Source event.  Obviously, I said that I would love to go, so off I went!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of the day was that there were a number of people from the Open Source Community there representing their projects, and different members of the tretton37 team were assigned to each project.  With that part done, we then set about hacking on the project.  This included a brief overview of what the project is, and then jumping in to work on some issues that were currently open.  In the end, I think we had 9 Pull Requests submitted, across a number of the Cake Repositories.  Also included in the day was a panel discussion about Open Source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I had an amazing day in Sweden (my first time visiting), and I was, and still am, amazed at the &lt;a href="https://tretton37.com/"&gt;tretton37&lt;/a&gt; Organisation for their commitment to Open Source and its Community.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aberdeen-developers"&gt;Aberdeen Developers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With one thing or another, I haven't been as active at Aberdeen Developers as I would have liked, but I am very happy to say that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nyami"&gt;Douglas&lt;/a&gt; has been keeping things ticking over nicely.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2017 saw events from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/march-2017-mark-allan/"&gt;Mark Allen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/march-2017-microsoft-special/"&gt;Martin Kearn and Martin Beeby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/june-2017-donovan-brown-zero-to-devops/"&gt;Donovan Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.aberdeendevelopers.co.uk/jun-2017-richard-campbell-history-of-net/"&gt;Richard Campbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow!  An amazing list of speakers.  Aberdeen is very lucky to have these people come and speak.  I am looking forward to getting more involved in Aberdeen Developers in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="chocolatey-contributions"&gt;Chocolatey Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, I have been working on a number of things related to Chocolatey, but there are two things that stand out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first is the release of Chocolatey GUI 0.15.0.  There is more information about this release &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/blog/chocolatey-gui-0.15.0-released"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  Put simply, this was a HUGE release, and saw essentially a complete re-write of major parts of the application.  There are loads more things planned for Chocolatey GUI (including a much awaited Tile View), so be sure to keep an eye out for that in the next release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second is with regard to &lt;a href="https://github.com/dtgm/chocolatey-packages"&gt;dtgm's Chocolatey Packages&lt;/a&gt;.  For those of you that don't know, dtgm has LOADS of Chocolatey packages, almost all of which are automated using ketarin.  However, dtgm hasn't been able to spend as much time maintaining these packages as he once did, and as a result, these packages have started to fail.  After a number of attempts to reach out to him, I was finally able to get access to his GitHub repository, and as a result, I have been able to start merging some of the long awaited PR's to fix some packages, and as well as to migrate some of his packages to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey-coreteampackages"&gt;Core Team Packages repository&lt;/a&gt;.  Now that I have access to this repository, I am hoping to be able to fix more of the packages that require attention, as well as migrate more of his packages to the Core Team packages repository.  If you are interested in helping with this work, please feel free to reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cake-contributions"&gt;Cake Contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been loads of exciting announcements for Cake in 2017, not least &lt;a href="https://cakebuild.net/blog/2017/11/intellisense-vscode"&gt;Intellisense for Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, my main focus this year has been growing the Cake-Contrib Organisation.  For those of you who know me, I am very passionate about the longevity and maintainability of Open Source Projects, and to that end, I am a HUGE advocate of not working in silos.  Instead, I much prefer to see projects being worked on within a GitHub Organisation, so that if the worst should happen or life gets in the way, other people can step in and help out.  That is what the Cake-Contrib Organisation is all about.  A place where Cake maintainers can place their repositories, knowing that they will still have full access to the repository, but also know that others can help out should the need arise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Related to this, is the cake-contrib user on NuGet.org.  Whenever I see a new Cake Addin being released, one of the first things that I do is submit an issue to the maintainer to add the cake-contrib user as a co-owner of the package.  This is really for two reasons.  The first being that it increases the publicity of that package, as people as able to &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/cake-contrib"&gt;find it easier&lt;/a&gt; as all packages are in one place.  The second is that it means other people can push a new package version, rather than it being locked down to a single user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2017, we were able to grow the Cake-Contrib Organisation to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;43 People now a member of the Organisation on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;110 Repositories now in the Organisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;202 Packages associated with the cake-contrib user on NuGet.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3,397,862 downloads of addins and modules associated with the cake-contrib user&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, this is amazing, and I am grateful to all the Cake Contributors who have chosen to join this Organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting side effect of this work is the synchronisation of permissions and settings that needs to happen between GitHub and AppVeyor (our main CI platform).  For the longest time, I was doing this manually, but it got to the point that this was completely unmanageable.  As a result, I now have a set of scripts that helps with the synchronisation of permissions and settings between GitHub and AppVeyor.  This will likely be the topic of a YouTube video this year, so keep an eye out for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is still work to be done here, and I will continue to reach out to the maintainers of addins and modules to see if they are interested in joining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="office-hours"&gt;Office Hours&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, after watching the work that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley"&gt;Geoffrey Huntley&lt;/a&gt; has been doing, I signed up for &lt;a href="https://officehours.io/people/gep13"&gt;Officehours&lt;/a&gt;.  Put simply, I think this is a great idea, and a great service.  If you have anything you wanted to talk to me about, whether about Cake, or Chocolatey, Build System, or Open Source in general, feel free to reach out and we can get something scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="thats-a-wrap"&gt;That's a wrap&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that as they say, is that!  Looking back, it has been a very busy, but very enjoyable year (aside for the sad times).  2018 is shaping up to be as busy, and I am truly excited to share some amazing news that will be happening at the end of January.  It is amazing!&lt;/p&gt;
</content>
		<summary>&lt;p&gt;In many ways, 2017 has been an amazing year, with lots of stuff happening both from a personal stand point, as well as other stuff.  It has also been a very sad year with the passing of both my Granny and my cousin.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>Introducing a Postman Collection for AppVeyor</title>
		<updated>2017-08-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;For a while now, I have been hacking on the AppVeyor API.  This has been in order to setup some automation between the various GitHub Teams that I have, and the AppVeyor Roles that allow access to the projects in AppVeyor.  This can of course be done manually, but when you start having over 30 teams, and over 70 projects, this becomes a bit of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While doing this, I found myself continually referring to the &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/api/"&gt;AppVeyor Documentation&lt;/a&gt; which is actually very good, and then doing little tests here and there using &lt;a href="https://www.getpostman.com/"&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; to verify things that I was trying to automate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It got to the point where I had created the same request a couple of times on different days, so it was time to do something else, as this was wasted effort!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without further ado, let me introduce a &lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/appveyor-postman"&gt;Postman Collection&lt;/a&gt; for all the requests that you can make against the AppVeyor API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A video explaining what this is, and how you can use it, can be seen here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8mVjJxt_ts" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, I intend to keep this collection up to date with any new API requests that are added to AppVeyor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions on how this can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>MVP Award Kit</title>
		<updated>2017-07-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;At the end of last week, I received my MVP Award Kit from Microsoft, but I am really only just now getting a chance to sit down and have a proper look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see photos of the unboxing below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="flickrembed"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;small style="display: block; text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;"&gt;Powered by &lt;a href="https://flickrembed.com"&gt;flickr embed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;script src="https://flickrembed.com/embed_v2.js.php?source=flickr&amp;layout=responsive&amp;input=72157684028641824&amp;sort=0&amp;by=album&amp;theme=default&amp;scale=fit&amp;skin=default&amp;id=5850544461b40"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say that I am very impressed with the kit.  It is a very nice gift to receive in addition to the recognition that goes with it.  Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to use AppVeyor Build Cache</title>
		<updated>2017-07-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;Another important feature offered by AppVeyor is it's &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-cache/"&gt;Build Cache&lt;/a&gt;.  Due to the fact that every AppVeyor build uses a fresh copy of the Build Agent Virtual Machine, any files and folders that were created as part of the build are not persisted between project builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example, if as part of your build you restore lots of NuGet packages, or you install packages from Chocolatey, then these things will have to happen on every build.  This is problematic for two reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It means that your builds are going to be slightly slower than they could be as they are having to restore these dependencies on every build&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The success of your build is dependent on 3rd party websites being available.  So for example, if NuGet.org isn't working properly, your build is going to fail as those required packages can't be downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making use of the AppVeyor Build Cache fixes both of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set up the Build Cache is really simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cache:
  - tools -&amp;gt; build.cake, tools/packages.config
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this entry in your &lt;code&gt;.appveyor.yml&lt;/code&gt; file, at the end of the build all files and folders within the &lt;code&gt;tools&lt;/code&gt; folder will be added to the Build Cache, and restored on the next build.  Additionally, if either of the &lt;code&gt;build.cake&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;tools/packages.config&lt;/code&gt; file change between Project Builds, then the tools folder in the Build Cache will be invalidated and re-created during the build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This configuration gives us full flexibility and control over the Build Cache, which results in a more resilient and re-producible build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a short video with walks through this entire process, and shows the Build Cache in action, in the context of a build which uses the &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/"&gt;Cake Build Automation tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to use AppVeyor Remote Desktop Connection</title>
		<updated>2017-07-23T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about AppVeyor is that it is a &lt;strong&gt;completely online Continuous Integration Server&lt;/strong&gt;.  You as a user don't have to worry about installing the latest version of it, or applying security patches, etc.  You can simply get on with the task at hand.  However, one of the worst things about AppVeyor is that it is a &lt;strong&gt;completely online Continuous Integration Server&lt;/strong&gt;.  Those times when the build isn't working, and you have no idea why, it can be difficult to figure it out solely based on the output logs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is where AppVeyor's unique ability to get a Remote Desktop Connection to the Build Agent is incredibly powerful!  You get complete administrator access to the VM for 60 minutes (either at the start of the build, or at the end of it), which gives to time to debug and figure out exactly what is going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is explained in the AppVeyor &lt;a href="https://www.appveyor.com/docs/how-to/rdp-to-build-worker/"&gt;documentation site&lt;/a&gt; but I thought I would create a short video explaining exactly how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5OHsXduezIw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h1 id="gotcha"&gt;Gotcha&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only gotcha that I ran into while creating this video is that although it isn't mentioned, the password that you create for logging into the server is subject to the standard complexity rules, for example mixed upper and lower case letters, use of numbers and special characters, etc.  If you use a password that doesn't meet with these requirements, you will get a build error similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/07/23/appveyor_rdp_password_error.png" class="img-fluid" alt="AppVeyor RDP Password Error" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Version 0.8.0 of the Visual Studio Code extension for Cake</title>
		<updated>2017-07-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;We are very happy to announce that a new version, 0.8.0, of the Visual Studio Code extension for Cake has just been released.  This release includes two main new features and one improvement.  These features really came about with the &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_14#_tasks"&gt;June release&lt;/a&gt; of Visual Studio Code, which brought with it a new Tasks API, making it possible for extension authors to &amp;quot;auto detect&amp;quot; tasks for execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="more-information"&gt;More information...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have created a short video which walks through the new features that are included in this release.  If you have any comments, please feel to reach out to discuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zzZuysl3xSg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-was-included-in-this-release"&gt;What was included in this release?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-vscode/issues/27"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#27&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Support ability to setup/install debugging dependencies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-vscode/issues/14"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#14&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Add ability to parse cake file(s) for tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake-vscode/issues/3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Support deactivation of extension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-does-this-new-version-help-me"&gt;How does this new version help me?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The features in this release are intended to help remove some of the manual steps that are required to both execute and debug tasks within your Cake scripts.  For example, rather than having to type out the build command, along with the target name, you can now simply click on the name for a list of all available targets.  In addition, rather than having to go through all the steps listed in this &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/09/debug-cake-vscode"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; to configure debugging of Cake scripts, it is now simply 2 or 3 clicks away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="getting-help"&gt;Getting Help...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first real foray into Visual Studio Code Extension development, and also TypeScript, so to say that I was stumbling at the first hurdle would be an understatement.  I have to say though, the Visual Studio Code development team, in particular &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erichgamma"&gt;Erich Gamma&lt;/a&gt;, are amazingly helpful.  As a result after:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter Conversations
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ErichGamma/status/885822561136803840"&gt;https://twitter.com/ErichGamma/status/885822561136803840&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually had something that worked!  Thank you to everyone on the team for their help with getting this release out!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>I am a Microsoft MVP</title>
		<updated>2017-07-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;I am very happy to announce that yesterday, &lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mvpawardprogram/2017/07/01/congratulations-mvps-july-17/?utm_source=t.co&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral"&gt;along with 35 other new people, and nearly 1400 renewed people&lt;/a&gt;, I was awarded with a Microsoft MVP Award!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of you who don't know, the Microsoft MVP Award, it is...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our way of saying &amp;quot;Thanks!&amp;quot; to outstanding community leaders. The contributions MVPs make to the community, ranging from speaking engagements, to social media posts, to writing books, to helping others in online communities, have incredible impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, you can find out more about it &lt;a href="https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/Overview"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I have often &amp;quot;thought&amp;quot; about being a Microsoft MVP, but I honestly never thought that I would be given one, so I am very happy to have recieved this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I found out the news yesterday, I was very excited.  I had literally just found out that a friend of mine, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devlead/status/881201782109728768"&gt;Mattias&lt;/a&gt;, had also been awarded with an MVP.  When I checked my email, I found that I too had recieved one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to getting involved in the MVP Community, and continuing to contribute in the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to all the other new, and renewed, MVP's!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Talk at DDD 12</title>
		<updated>2017-06-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;p&gt;On the 10th June 2017, I had the privelege of being asked to present a session at &lt;a href="http://developerdeveloperdeveloper.com/"&gt;DDD 12&lt;/a&gt;.  This is a free full day conference that takes place in the Microsoft Offices at Thames Valley Park in Reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk that I presented was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Control your GitHub releases with GitVersion and GitReleaseManager&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and the abstract was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever needed to control the version number of your open source application on GitHub? If so, you will likely know that it can be hard! You may have tried to use some form of auto incrementing number, or stored the version in a text file hoping that someone will remember to update it. Both of these approaches (and there are plenty others) will work, but they are fragile, and don’t account for some of the more complicated scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, after controlling the version number, you then want to generate Release Notes for that newly released version.  How can you do this without manually trawling through the revision history?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, we will look at how we can improve the versioning strategy of your application using a combination of branching strategy (Gitflow), Semantic Versioning, an open source tool called GitVersion, and the commit history of your Git repository.  With the version number in place, we will then use the Issue and Milestone tracking functionality in GitHub to automatically generate a set of concise release notes using a tool called GitReleaseManager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the first time that I had presented this talk, and overall, I was very happy with how it went.  This time around, after seeing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fekberg"&gt;&amp;#64;fekberg&lt;/a&gt; doing the same thing at a DDD conference last year, I opted to record the session on my laptop, and also on an external microphone, so that there would be a record of it.  If you weren't able to attend the session, or are simply interested in checking it out, you can find the video on YouTube:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SlM02V1tkSc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

		<title>Introducing Cake.Chocolatey.Module</title>
		<updated>2017-03-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="or-as-i-like-to-call-it"&gt;Or as I like to call it...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chocolatey Cake Module!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="what-is-it"&gt;What is it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in version &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake/releases/tag/v0.13.0"&gt;0.13.0&lt;/a&gt; of Cake a feature known as &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/cake/issues/646"&gt;Module Support&lt;/a&gt; was released.  This provided the ability to both extend and replace some of the built in functionality of Cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these extension points is the registration of &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/api/Cake.Core.Packaging/IPackageInstaller/"&gt;IPackageInstaller&lt;/a&gt;'s, which deal with installing tools and addins during the Cake Script execution.  The Chocolatey Cake Module provide the extension point to allow tools to be resolved using Chocolatey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Chocolatey deals with the installation of applications.  As a result, it only makes sense for this module to deal with tools, and not addins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="why-is-this-needed"&gt;Why is this needed?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, Cake has the ability to install tools and addins from any NuGet source.  This is documented on the &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/docs/fundamentals/preprocessor-directives"&gt;Cake Website&lt;/a&gt;.  Recently, &lt;a href="https://github.com/larzw"&gt;Larz White&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/blog/2017/01/cake-paket"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; how it was possible to use an alternative package manager, namely &lt;a href="https://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/"&gt;Paket&lt;/a&gt; to install those tools and addins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all tools that you require for your build may be available as NuGet Packages.  This leaves you with two options (there are likely more, but for the purposes of this discussion, let's stick to two), you could either pre-install the required tools onto the build machine that you are using, or look to install those tools through a custom script, perhaps through something like &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/"&gt;Chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I joined the Cake Team, one of the first things that I did was to add &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/dsl/chocolatey/"&gt;Chocolatey Aliases&lt;/a&gt; to Cake, so you have always been able to install Chocolatey packages as part of your build process, using something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ChocolateyInstall(&amp;quot;MyChocolateyPackage&amp;quot;);
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, that removes an element of clarity over what tooling is required for the build.  I would much rather see all of the dependencies in one place, i.e. here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// TOOLS
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

#tool nuget:?package=coveralls.io&amp;amp;version=1.3.4
#tool nuget:?package=gitreleasemanager&amp;amp;version=0.5.0
#tool nuget:?package=GitVersion.CommandLine&amp;amp;version=3.6.2
#tool nuget:?package=JetBrains.ReSharper.CommandLineTools&amp;amp;version=2016.3.20161223.160402
#tool nuget:?package=ReSharperReports&amp;amp;version=0.2.0
#tool nuget:?package=KuduSync.NET&amp;amp;version=1.3.1
#tool nuget:?package=Wyam&amp;amp;version=0.16.1
#tool nuget:?package=gitlink&amp;amp;version=2.4.1
#tool nuget:?package=MSBuild.Extension.Pack&amp;amp;version=1.9.0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with all the other tools that I use in my build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is what this Cake Module allows you to do.  You can now add the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#tool choco:?package=nodejs.install&amp;amp;version=7.7.3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which would install version 7.7.3 of the &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs.install"&gt;node.install package from chocolatey.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="installation"&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that Cake Modules are extending and altering the internals of the Cake, the Module Assembly needs to be loaded prior to the main Cake execution.  As a result, the only place that this can really happen is during the bootstrapping phase.  If you use the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/resources/commit/3d112812353d714dad142c41f170b949f4a2eb2f"&gt;latest version of the default bootstrapper&lt;/a&gt; this process is made very easy.  All you need to do is the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a modules folder into your tools folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a packages.config file into the newly created modules folder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the name and version of the Module that you want to use.  &lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; At this point, the assumption is that you are hosting the Module on NuGet.org.  If this is not the case, then additional steps would be required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An example packages.config file is shown below:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version=&amp;quot;1.0&amp;quot; encoding=&amp;quot;utf-8&amp;quot;?&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;packages&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;package id=&amp;quot;Cake.Chocolatey.Module&amp;quot; version=&amp;quot;0.1.0&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/packages&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the build as normal.  During the Cake Execution, it will recognise the Module Assembly which as been restored into the &lt;code&gt;tools/modules&lt;/code&gt; folder, and load it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Similar to the recommendation &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/docs/tutorials/getting-started"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; regarding only checking in your packages.config and not the entire contents of the Cake tools folder, the same recommendation is applied here.  Only check-in the packages.config file in the modules folder, and not the entire contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="usage"&gt;Usage&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, installing a tool using the Chocolatey Cake Module is as simple as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#tool choco:?package=nodejs.install&amp;amp;version=7.7.3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the tool in question comes from a different source, you can change that as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#tool choco:https://www.myget.org/F/gep13/api/v2?package=gep13.gitConfig&amp;amp;version=1.0.6
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this version 0.1.0 release of the Chocolatey Cake Module you can also specify whether the package in question is a pre-release or not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#tool choco:?package=packageA&amp;amp;prerelease
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future versions of the Chocolatey Cake Module will include additional options for installing the package, including things like &lt;code&gt;--forcex86&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--install-arguments&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;--package-parameters&lt;/code&gt;, etc.  This initial release includes just the very basic of installation functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="documentation"&gt;Documentation&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find additional documentation for this module here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Chocolatey.Module/"&gt;https://cake-contrib.github.io/Cake.Chocolatey.Module/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>How to run Octobox on Synology Server using Docker</title>
		<updated>2017-03-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="what-is-octobox"&gt;What is Octobox?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer, it is amazing!  The main site can be found &lt;a href="https://octobox.io/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the source code on GitHub can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/octobox/octobox"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slightly longer answer, it is a UI that allows you to take back control over your GitHub Notifications, with functionality for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Archiving Notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starring issues/pull requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting an indication on the sort of subscription you have on the issue/pull request&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Loads of other features that will help you make sense of all the notifications&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id="why-do-you-need-this"&gt;Why do you need this?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If like me, on a daily basis you will have a torrent of email notifications that come through for the different issues/pull requests that you have subscribed to on GitHub.  These could be for issues/pull requests that you have raised, and a response is required from you, or simply issues/pull requests that you have a vested interested in following along.  Whatever the reason, the amount of notifications is huge, and can be overwhelming.  The main problem with both email and web notifications, is that normally once you have looked at them, they are gone, never to be seen again.  If you get distracted and move onto something else, it is all to easy to forget what you were looking at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Octobox to the rescue...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where, for me, Octobox shines!  Once configured, issues/pull requests that you are actively looking at remain in your &amp;quot;Inbox&amp;quot;, as can be seen here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/Octobox%20Inbox.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Octobox Inbox" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are finished with an issue/pull request you have the option of archiving it, but have no fear, if another notification comes up for that issue/pull request, it will come back into your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not a very difficult concept, but the way it is implemented is VERY compelling, and such an improvement on the current notification system in the GitHub UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="enough-already-how-to-we-use-it"&gt;Enough already, how to we use it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple options here...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, you can use the shared instance at &lt;a href="http://octobox.io,"&gt;http://octobox.io,&lt;/a&gt; however, this is limited in some functionality due to not being able to use shared key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you can deploy your own instance to Heroku, which seems like it would be very simple to set up and configure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, you have the option of running Octobox in Docker.  I opted for this option for a couple reasons.  I have never really used Docker in anger, and I wanted to see what all the fuss is about.  And also I have a reasonably beefy Synology Server that really isn't doing anything, other then running &lt;a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/UPDATED2014HowToSetupCrashPlanCloudBackupOnASynologyNASRunningDSM50.aspx"&gt;CrashPlan&lt;/a&gt; and Plex.  So I thought I would take it for a spin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="setup-steps"&gt;Setup steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="install-docker"&gt;1. Install Docker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a reasonably straight forward process.  Login to the DSM and select Package Center, and then search from Docker.  There should only be one result, with the option to Install.  &lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The screenshot below shows the Open option simply because it is already installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/Package_Center_Docker.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Package Center Docker" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="install-git-server"&gt;2. Install Git Server&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to download the latest source code for Octobox, you are going to need to have git installed and running on your Synology Server.  The easiest way to do this is to install the Git Server Package.  Once again in the Package Center, search for git, and install the Git Server Package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/Package_Center_Git.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Package Center Git" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="clone-the-octobox-repository"&gt;3. Clone the octobox repository&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up, we are going to need to clone the octobox source code onto the Synology Server.  In order to do this, we are going to need to execute commands over SSH on the Synology Server.  To do this, you will need to make sure that the SSH Service is running, and then establish an SSH connection to the Server.  First things first... In the DSM, select Control Panel, and then search for SSH.  In the results, select Terminal and SNMP, and make sure that the following checkbox is ticked, and then click Apply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/Control_Panel_SSH.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Control Panel SSH" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, using an SSH Client application (I personally use kitty, which can be installed easily using &lt;a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/kitty"&gt;chocolatey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;choco install kitty&lt;/code&gt;), connect to the Synology Server.  This will require entering in your Synology Server IP address, and the same credentials you use to access the DSM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once in, create a folder for cloning the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir github/clones/octobox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and navigate into that folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd github/clones/octobox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then clone the repository:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/octobox/octobox.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and finally, navigate into that newly created repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd octobox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="create-an-oauth-application-for-octobox"&gt;4. Create an OAuth Application for Octobox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to run the Octobox application, you are going to need a GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET.  These can be acquired by setting up a new OAuth Application within GitHub.  Go to the following &lt;a href="https://github.com/settings/applications/new"&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; and set up the application using the IP Address of your device, in my case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/GitHub_OAuth_Application.png" class="img-fluid" alt="GitHub OAuth Application Settings" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a note of the Client ID and Client Secret that will be generated for the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="create-the-docker-containers"&gt;5. Create the Docker Containers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to run, Octobox needs two Docker images, namely a ruby and postgre image.  Once instantiated, these images will run together to execute and persist the various information within the application.  Octobox makes use of Docker Compose to orchestrate the creation and running of these Containers.  To start that process (which the first time you run it will take quite a while) you can run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=yourclientid GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=yourclientsecret docker-compose up --build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Replace the required sections with the client id and secret that you got in step 4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if like me, the first time you run this, you will get this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/docker_error.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Docker Error" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, if you run this again using &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; and accept the mandatory lecture, it should start running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/sudo_ftw.png" class="img-fluid" alt="sudo FTW!" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="get-a-coffeetea"&gt;6. Get a coffee/tea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that this process is running it will take a while, so I would advise going to grab a beverage.  On my machine, it took about 30 minutes to complete.  During this process, if you look at the Docker UI within the Synology DSM, you will see it creating temporary Containers, which will ultimately be renamed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/docker_temporary_containers.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Docker Temporary Containers" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end result, once complete, should look like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/Completed_Docker_Images.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Completed Docker Images" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/Completed_Docker_Containers.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Completed Docker Containers" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="doh"&gt;7. Doh!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, after all that waiting around, like me, you might end up with the following error message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/things_not_looking_good.png" class="img-fluid" alt="When things go wrong..." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all honesty, I have no real idea about what this error means, but, if you go to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers"&gt;URL&lt;/a&gt; that is mentions, and run the command that is lists (which at the time of writing was the following):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo sysctl -p&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/echo_output.png" class="img-fluid" alt="echo output" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, if you run the &lt;code&gt;docker compose&lt;/code&gt; command again, which should take far less time the second time around, you should be met with the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/docker_compose_success.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Docker Compose Success" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="open-octobox"&gt;8. Open Octobox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fire open your browser of choice, and point it at &lt;a href="http://%3Csynology_server_ip_address%3E:3000"&gt;http://&amp;lt;synology_server_ip_address&amp;gt;:3000&lt;/a&gt; and hopefully you will see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/13/its_alive.png" class="img-fluid" alt="It's ALIVE!" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you will be able to login to the application using your standard credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="run-docker-command-in-background"&gt;9. Run docker command in background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command that we ran earlier run in process in the kitty session that we created.  As a result, hitting CTRL + C, or terminating the session will also terminate the Docker Containers, which is not really what we want.  Instead, go ahead and run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=yourclientid GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=yourclientsecret docker-compose up --build -d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; The important &lt;code&gt;-d&lt;/code&gt; switch at the end.  This will run the command in the background, and allow you to terminate the kitty session without stopping the containers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="and-that-is-that"&gt;10. And that is that!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is all there is to it!  I have been using Octobox for a couple days now, and I have to say that it is amazing!  I have been able to turn off all email notifications now, and I still feel that I am getting all the information that I need, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As one point of follow up, rather than typing out the above command, you might want to take a look at this &lt;a href="https://blog.agchapman.com/using-variables-in-docker-compose-files/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; which describes how to use an .env file to store the secure information. Big thanks to Alistair for his help here!&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Signing GitHub Commits with Keybase.io</title>
		<updated>2017-03-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="tell-us-how-to-do-it-already"&gt;Tell us how to do it already!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, for the second time I had to sit down and figure out how to set up signing on my GitHub commits using the GPG Key which is provided by &lt;a href="https://keybase.io/"&gt;keybase.io&lt;/a&gt;, so it is time to write it down so that I don't forget how to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="standing-on-the-shoulders-of-giants"&gt;Standing on the shoulders of giants...&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all the steps that I follow are taken from this &lt;a href="https://www.herebedragons.io/sign-commits-keybase"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Jan De Dobbeleer, so kudos to him for writing it up in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="the-steps"&gt;The steps&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already have a keybase.io account, and therefore the steps involved in setting that up are not covered here, but in truth, it is very simple.  Head on over to their site and walk through the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install keybase.io CLI Tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install gpg4win-vanilla:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;choco install gpg4win-vanilla&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add keybase folder to path:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\gary.park\AppData\Local\Keybase;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Export keybase keys and import into gpg4win:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;keybase pgp export | gpg --import&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import private key:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;keybase pgp export --secret | gpg --allow-secret-key-import --import&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the ID for your key by using this command:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;gpg --list-secret-keys&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using that ID, edit the key to make it trusted:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;gpg --edit-key F6993303&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;trust&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With these steps done, I am ready to continue with setting up git to use the new gpg key.  This is due to the fact that I have already imported the public key into GitHub.  If you haven't done that part yet, then I would encourage you to follow the steps on the linked blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than having to remember the various git configurations that I use, I have a chocolatey package that I use to set everything up.  As a result, I can simply run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;choco install gep13.gitConfig --source &amp;quot;'https://www.myget.org/F/gep13/api/v2;https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/'&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and all my git configuration will be applied, including setting up signing on commits, and my default merge/diff tools, etc.  If you are interested in the commands that I execute, you can find them all &lt;a href="https://github.com/gep13/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/gep13.gitConfig/tools/ChocolateyInstall.ps1"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with all of that in place, the next time you do a commit on GitHub, you should see the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/09/verified-github-commit.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Verified GitHub Commit" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which, if you then drill into, will show additional information:&lt;/p&gt;

		<summary>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, for the second time I had to sit down and figure out how to set up signing on my GitHub commits using the GPG Key which is provided by &lt;a href="https://keybase.io/"&gt;keybase.io&lt;/a&gt;, so it is time to write it down so that I don't forget how to do it again.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

		<title>An Update on Cake-Contrib User and Organisation</title>
		<updated>2017-03-09T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<content>&lt;h1 id="what-a-6-months-it-has-been"&gt;What a 6 months it has been!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in August 2016, I (with the support of the rest of the Cake Team), put out a &amp;quot;call to arms&amp;quot; to the Cake Community.  What we were trying to address was the &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; stagnation of Addin's and Modules that were created by the Cake Community.  Full details of what we were trying to address can be found in this &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/blog/2016/08/cake-contribution-organization"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="current-status"&gt;Current Status&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6 months on, I am very proud to say that the Cake Community has come together in an amazing way.  As it currently stands, there are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;122&lt;/strong&gt; Cake Addin's and &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; Modules are hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=cake"&gt;NuGet.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;35&lt;/strong&gt; Addin's and Modules have been moved under the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-contrib"&gt;cake-contrib organisation on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;87&lt;/strong&gt; Addin's have been documented and submitted to the &lt;a href="http://cakebuild.net/addins/"&gt;Cake Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintainers of &lt;strong&gt;101&lt;/strong&gt; Addin's have chosen to add the cake-contrib user as a co-maintainer of the package on &lt;a href="https://www.nuget.org/profiles/cake-contrib"&gt;NuGet.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all very much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is important, and I am particularly happy that maintainers have chosen to do this.  What this means is that, if a maintainer were no longer able/willing to support an Addin, the Cake Team would be in a position to continue to push updates to the same package id on NuGet.org.  As a result, we can ensure the continuation of support for that particular package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, I want to stress here that this would only ever happen after every effort was made to get in touch with the original creator of the Cake Addin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very useful site effect of the cake-contrib user being added to so many NuGet packages is that we get a clear indication of the usage of the Addin's.  As of today, the packages that have been added to the cake-contrib user have been downloaded 315,909 times!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://gep13wpstorage.blob.core.windows.net/gep13/2017/03/09/cake-contrib-downloads.png" class="img-fluid" alt="cake-contrib package downloads" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="going-forward"&gt;Going Forward&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am continuing to encourage Addin and Module creators to both document, and add the cake-contrib NuGet user to, packages that they create.  I am tracking this on this &lt;a href="https://github.com/cake-build/website/issues/149"&gt;GitHub issue&lt;/a&gt;.  From time to time I check NuGet.org for new packages that have been pushed, so don't be surprised if I raise some issues on your repository once I know about the existence of the package.  This is not meant has any form of harassment, so apologies if it feels like that, but rather, trying to do what is best for the larger Cake Community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, a huge thank you to all the Cake Community, we very much appreciate your time, and Cake wouldn't be where it is today without you.&lt;/p&gt;
