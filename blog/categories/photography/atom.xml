    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As a birthday gift last year I was given a 4 hour Photography Training Course with Apex Photographics (thank you again Caroline!).  You can find their website <a href="http://apexphotographics.co.uk/">here</a>.  After finally sitting down to decide when I will be doing this course, I have decided to go along on Monday 6th February.  I had originally booked it for Saturday 4th, but due to the fact that I am now attending <a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/i-am-attending-the-uk-tech-days-in-london/">UK Tech Days</a> in London, I am not able to make it at the weekend.  I have no idea what to expect from the course, as I haven’t taken any proper pictures for a long time now (you can see some of my efforts on flickr <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gep13/">here</a>), but I am very much looking forward to learning something new.  I will post back once I have attended the tuition, and I will upload some of the photos that I take.</p>

<p>On another note, after hearing the news that the Nikon <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/nikon-d700-d300s-discontinued-1057814?src=rss&amp;attr=all">D700 is being discontinued</a>, now is maybe a good time to start thinking about a new camera as well <img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/wlEmoticon-smile4.png" alt="Smile" /></p>
