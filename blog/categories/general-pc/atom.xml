    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>tl;dr</h1>

<p>Really nice keyboard, and would definitely recommend!</p>

<!--more-->


<h1>Getting started with my new Sculpt Keyboard</h1>

<p><strong>Full Disclaimer:</strong> I have only been using this keyboard for about 2 hours. The opinions shared here may change over time, and if they do, I will update the blog post to reflect this.</p>

<p>For over five years now, I have been the proud owner of the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000. I liked this keyboard so much that I actually bought two of them. One for the office, and one for home. However, as with most things, there comes a time when items need to be replaced. For me, with this particular keyboard, this was mainly due to the fact that on my work version, the “y” key had become flaky. Every so often, even though it was definitely being pushed, it simply wouldn’t work. The &ldquo;solution&rdquo; was to hit the key really hard, and it would eventually work. When I decided to leave my old job, I also decided it was time to replace the keyboard, and have a new one for my new job. New beginnings and all that…</p>

<p>When I was given some Amazon vouchers as part of my leaving present, I thought that this would be the perfect opportunity to get the new keyboard, and so I bought <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-gb/p/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/L5V-00006">this</a>.</p>

<p>I have since had this delivered, and I am in fact using it to write this blog post. What are my thoughts so far I hear you ask? Well, let me tell you…</p>

<!--more-->


<h2>The Keyboard</h2>

<p>I really like it! It is much smaller than the 4000, but this is mainly due to the keys that it doesn’t have, i.e. the NumPad. You can see the Sculpt Keyboard sitting on top of the 4000 in the picture below:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2227&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;584&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/old-new-sculpt-ergonomic/wp_20140607_19_36_45_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140607_19_36_45_Pro-1024x576.jpg" alt="Sculpt sitting on top of 4000" /></a> Sculpt sitting on top of 4000[/caption]</p>

<p>The keyboard itself feels very solid, which is good. Access to the battery compartment is via a magnetised cover (all the devices, keyboard, mouse and Number Pad, all share this feature), which makes inserting/changing the batteries very simple. The keys feel much less mechanical than the 4000, which was a common complaint of that device, and they don’t take as much movement of the fingers to depress the keys. It actually feels more like typing on a laptop keyboard, but with the benefit of the split keyboard layout</p>

<p>With the aid of a toggle switch, each function key can be used as a shortcut for Windows 8 functions, such as Search, Share, Settings, etc. This isn’t something that I think I will be making use of. I will keep it in Function Key mode, and simply use keyboard shortcuts like &ldquo;Windows+C&rdquo; to get to the required functionality.</p>

<p>Initially, the split space bar seemed a little to me, however, having used it, this makes sense. I typically hit the space bar with my right thumb, and I am finding it much easier to press, as you are not having to depress a much larger key.</p>

<h2>The Mouse</h2>

<p>When I took the mouse out of the box, my immediate reaction was, euch! What is that bulbous, monstrosity!</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2224&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;584&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/old-new-sculpt-ergonomic/wp_20140607_19_35_44_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140607_19_35_44_Pro-1024x576.jpg" alt="Microsoft Sculpt Mouse" /></a> Microsoft Sculpt Mouse[/caption]</p>

<p>However, having used it for a while, I am actually getting used to it, and I think I will like it. The addition of the Windows key, to take you to the Start Screen is a nice touch, and the back button (which I have come to rely on with my mice) is a very welcome addition.</p>

<h2>The Number Pad</h2>

<p>What can I say, it’s a Number Pad.</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2225&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;576&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/old-new-sculpt-ergonomic/wp_20140607_19_35_56_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140607_19_35_56_Pro-576x1024.jpg" alt="Microsoft Sculpt Number Pad" /></a> Microsoft Sculpt Number Pad[/caption]</p>

<p>It does exactly what it says on the tin. While using the trio of devices, I have found myself looking for the Number Pad directly to the right of the keyboard (when entering an IP address, for instance) and it hasn’t been there. I think that will take a minute to get used to, but on the whole, the Number Pad is not a common input mechanism for me, so I don’t think I will mind having to move further to find it when required.</p>

<h2>The Transceiver</h2>

<p>This to me seems quite big, I would have expected it to be smaller, similar to that of my Fitbit or Garmin connector, shown below:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2228&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;584&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/old-new-sculpt-ergonomic/wp_20140607_19_37_52_pro/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/WP_20140607_19_37_52_Pro-1024x576.jpg" alt="Sculpt Transceiver compared to Garmin one" /></a> Sculpt Transceiver compared to Garmin one[/caption]</p>

<p>The only thing I can think is that it needs to be larger due to the fact that it is a single transceiver for all three devices. When not required, or being transported, there is a slot in the inside of the mouse for storing it. Again, this is a magnetized slot, so immediately when stored, it feels secure.</p>

<p>One word of warning though:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ijonas/status/463983735365697536">https://twitter.com/ijonas/status/463983735365697536</a></p>

<h2>The setup</h2>

<p>This really was a snap! Took everything out of the box, removed the battery savings strips, plugged in the transceiver, small driver install, and everything worked. I am running Windows 8.1.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>How I finally got the Wireless Button (F2) on my Dell Studio 1558 working&hellip;</h1>

<p>After a very annoying couple of days with no wireless connection on my laptop, I was finally able to get it working.  Hopefully this will help anyone else who falls into the same problem.</p>

<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>After doing a fresh install of Windows 8 on my Dell Studio 1558, I thought that everything was working perfectly.  Since the original install, I had no issues whatsoever.  However, the other day, I accidentally pressed the F2 key (this is the hardware button which will enable/disable the wireless radio).  I wasn&rsquo;t too concerned when this happened, as I thought that I could just press it again, and it would re-enable the radio, but&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;this didn&rsquo;t happen!  I was stuck with no wireless connection.</p>

<p>I tried everything that I could think of to fix the problem, and I couldn&rsquo;t get anything to work.  Everything seemed to be correct, but I still couldn&rsquo;t get a wireless connection.  What I was left with was this:</p>

<p>[gallery ids=&ldquo;1889,1890,1891&rdquo;]</p>

<h1></h1>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<p>After googling everything that I could think of, I eventually, out of sheer desperation, decided to try using the &ldquo;Diagnose&rdquo; wizard, that you can find when right clicking on the network connection in control panel:</p>

<p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1888&rdquo; align=&ldquo;alignnone&rdquo; width=&ldquo;359&rdquo;]<a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/problem-with-wireless-button-f2-on-dell-studio-1558-and-windows-8/diagnose_context_menu/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Diagnose_Context_Menu.png" alt="Diagnose Context Menu" /></a> Diagnose Context Menu[/caption]</p>

<p>This started a wizard which correctly identified that the Wireless Radio was indeed disabled  and to my surprise, provided an option to re-enable it.  I am happy to report that I now have a functioning wireless connection.  In addition, <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/w/laptop/4232.studio-1558-windows-8-64-bit.aspx">one of the sites</a> that I did stumble across, contained a complete list of Windows 8 compatible drivers for the Dell Studio 1558.  It would seem that Dell are not creating/maintaining Windows 8 compatible drivers, so the above site is the only unofficial list of compatible drivers for Windows 8.  I updated to the latest Intel Wireless Driver, and it is all now working!</p>

    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/synaptics-device-driver-for-dell-studio-1558-trackpad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>New Synaptics Driver means Windows 8 Gestures now work on my Dell Studio 1558</h1>

<p>Out of the box, installing Windows 8 onto my Dell Studio 1558 meant that the Windows 8 Gestures for my Trackpad (i.e. pinch to zoom, two finger vertical scroll, and two finger horizontal scroll) didn&rsquo;t work.  Dell offered an updated trackpad driver, but this didn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>

<p>In all honesty, I didn&rsquo;t really miss not having it, as typically I use a portable USB Wireless mouse when out and about.  However, after watching Scott Hanselman&rsquo;s (<a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman">@shanselman</a>) <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheMissingWindows8InstructionalVideo.aspx">25 minute introduction video to Windows 8</a>, I decided that it was time to try to get this working!</p>

<p>After a bit of searching, I turned up this <a href="http://www.synaptics.com/resources/drivers">page</a>, which seemed to be exactly what I needed.  I was holding out too much hope, as I had tried a previous version of the Synaptics Driver, and it also hadn&rsquo;t worked.  To my surprise, and delight, I am happy to say that it is now working!</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with the gestures that I am referring to be sure to check out Paul Thurrott&rsquo;s (<a href="http://twitter.com/thurrott">@thurrott</a>) blog post <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/windows-8-tip-use-trackpad-multi-touch-gestures">here</a>, as it has all the details.</p>

<p>I can see me using these gestures more and more when using my laptop, and only cracking out the mouse when doing more intense stuff on the laptop.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/first-impressions-of-windows-8-and-office-365-home-premium-preview/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-01T10:21:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/first-impressions-of-windows-8-and-office-365-home-premium-preview</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Installing Windows 8</h1>

<p>A couple of weeks ago, after purchasing a new <a href="http://www.crucial.com/uk/store/mpartspecs.aspx?mtbpoid=46122D1FA5CA7304">128GB SSD from Crucial</a>, I decided to take the plunge and get Windows 8 installed. I have heard mixed feedback on Windows 8, but like most things, you have to take it with a pinch of salt, until you try it for yourself. The outcome? I have to say, I really like it! Those who think they know me, will likely look to accuse me of being &ldquo;fanboi&rdquo;, but that is simply not the case. You can see immediately that a lot of thought has gone into the creation of Windows 8. Even if you are not a fan of the Windows 8 start screen, take a look at the Desktop of Windows 8 and I think you will be pleasantly surprised!</p>

<h1>What is there to like?</h1>

<p>Lots!</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Boot Time</strong>: The boot up time is amazing! Now, a lot of this can be put down to the new SSD, but I would guess that you will see an improvement on a normal hard drive as well.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Start Screen</strong>: Like it or hate it, the Start Screen is here, and I would encourage you to embrace it. Having had a Windows Phone for the last year and a half, I am very used to the live tile updates, and I now see it as a very useful feature. The immediate search for an application by simply typing the name at the start screen is very useful.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integration with online services</strong>: As soon as I installed Windows 8, I immediately switched to a Windows Account, rather than a local account. As soon as I did this, my machine was immediately aware of all on online services, Hotmail, Facebook, etc, and the local applications immediately started using them. I personally really like how all these services are merged within Windows 8, but I can understand that some people may not like this.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>New Task Manager</strong>: I am not going to say any more about this, just go and take a look. You&rsquo;ll like it! Especially interesting and useful is the &ldquo;Start-up&rdquo; tab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>File Copy/Move Dialog</strong>: Same as above, just go and take a look. Some really great improvements here, that the geek in you will love!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Windows + X</strong>: If you are struggling with the new interface, and just want to get back to basics, make sure that you take a look at the &ldquo;Windows + X&rdquo; shortcut. This will give you quick access to most of the things that you will need.</p></li>
</ul>


<h1>What do you need to install?</h1>

<p>Once the base Operating System was installed, I immediately put out a question on Twitter asking what I need to get installed:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/gep13/status/248747605868294144">https://twitter.com/gep13/status/248747605868294144</a></p>

<p>And I have to say I was surprised by some of the comments. Some people immediately said that I had to install things like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/">http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>An application that makes Windows 8 look and feel and Windows 7. Personally, I am not going to install anything like this, I fully intend to embrace the paradigm that is Windows 8, and give it a try. I have to say that so far, I haven&rsquo;t found anything that I don&rsquo;t like. Granted, there has been a learning curve, but not a steep one, and there are plenty of resources out there to help you get up to speed.</p>

<p>Some of the first applications that I did install were Visual Studio 2012 and the Office 365 Home Premium Preview. More on Office 365 later. Normally, I go through a process of installing all the applications that I &ldquo;think&rdquo; I am going to use. However, this time around I am going to hold off on doing a bulk installation, and only install the packages that I need. On top of that, I am hoping to complete a <a href="http://chocolatey.org/">chocolatey</a> installation package that I can then re-use.</p>

<h1>Installing Office 365 Home Premium Preview</h1>

<p>The latest version of Microsoft Office has been given a completely new branding, and licensing; you are now able to install it onto 5 different computers.</p>

<p>There are some really nice touches in the new Office, and the SkyDrive integration is very good. One immediately noticeable improvement is best seen in PowerPoint. The presentation mode is VERY good, and will come in very useful in my upcoming presentations.</p>

<p>If you are interested in taking a look at the Office 365 Home Premium Preview, you can find it <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/preview/en/office-365-home-premium">here</a>.</p>

<p>Below you will see a number of screenshots that show both the installation process for Office 365 Home Premium Preview, as well as the look and feel of each application within the Suite.</p>

<p>I should point out that I did the installation across a lunch hour, using Internet Tethering on my Windows Phone 7. The idea of streaming the necessary functionality as and when required means that the initial installation package is far smaller than previous versions of Office, and installation over a 3G connection is certainly a possibility.</p>

    <link href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat/"/>
    <updated>2012-09-14T15:41:14+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you checked to make sure that your development rig supports SLAT?  Do you even know what SLAT is?  I didn’t until today, and it looks like I am going to have to upgrade at least one of my machines.</p>

<h1>What is SLAT?</h1>

<p>SLAT is referring to Second Level Address Translation, and it is a:</p>

<blockquote>…form of hardware virtualization that is included in newer version of Intel and AMD Processors, such as Intel’s Core i3, i5 and i7 processors and AMD;s Barcelona processors.</blockquote>


<p>For more information on exactly what this means, take a look at this <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/talsa/archive/2012/03/15/windows-8-server-hyper-v-will-require-slat-second-level-address-translation.aspx">blog post</a> from Tal Sarid.</p>

<h1>Why do I care?</h1>

<p>The reason that this is going to be a big deal for me, and why I am going to have to buy some new hardware is that the Windows Phone 8 emulator uses Hyper-V, and as a result, I am going to need hardware that supports SLAT if I want to run that emulator.  For more information on this, take a look at this <a href="http://www.wpcentral.com/windows-phone-8-emulator%E2%80%99s-hardware-requirements">wpcentral blog post</a>.</p>

<h1>How can I check whether my hardware supports SLAT?</h1>

<p>Thanks for Mark Russinovich, there is a Sysinternals tool called Coreinfo, which will tell you whether your current hardware can support SLAT.  See Ryan Lowdermilk’s <a href="http://www.ryanlowdermilk.com/2012/09/does-my-computer-support-slat/">blog post here</a> for the exact steps that you need to follow.</p>

<h1>My results</h1>

<p>For my desktop machine, which in fairness is VERY old, SLAT is not supported:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat/desktop_output/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Desktop_Output.png" alt="SLAT not support on Desktop" /></a></p>

<p>The good news however is that SLAT is supported on my laptop:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat/laptop_output/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Laptop_Output.png" alt="SLAT is support on Laptop" /></a></p>

<p>NOTE: The important thing that you need to look for (for Intel chips) is the asterisk next to EPT.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Based on the comment from Andy Westgarth below, if you are running coreinfo.exe on a machine that already has Hyper-V installed, you will get a different message returned.  Be careful to read all the output from this command.  When Hyper-V was installed on my new machine, this is the output that I got:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/does-your-development-rig-support-slat/2012-09-27_2033/"><img src="http://www.gep13.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2012-09-27_2033.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Note the important text:</p>

<p><em><strong>&ldquo;Coreinfo must be executed on a system without a hypervisor running for accurate results.&rdquo;</strong></em></p>
