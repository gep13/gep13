<p>For those of you who are not familiar with the format of DDD events, it goes a little something like this&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Potential Speakers submit their sessions for consideration</li>
<li>Community Voting is then opened, and the Community decides on which talks they want to see</li>
<li>The speakers with the sessions with the most votes are then contacted, and the sessions are then scheduled</li>
</ul>


<p>If you haven&rsquo;t been to a DDD event before, I thoroughly recommend to give one a try.  They really are great fun!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Continuous Integration 101</h1>

<p>On Saturday 23rd November 2013, I presented a talk entitled &ldquo;Continuous Integration 101&rdquo; at the <a href="http://dun.dddscotland.com/">DunDDD Conference in Dundee</a>.  The abstract for the talk was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>It is well understood that &#8220;Continuous Integration&#8221; is a development best practice, however, it is also something that is not often implemented within development teams. Typical reasons include:

- It is difficult to set up
- It is difficult to maintain
- It takes too long

In this session we will look at how you can incrementally work your way to fully implementing Continuous Integration into your development process. This talk will focus on using TeamCity as the Continuous Integration Server and psake build engine.</blockquote>

<p>Overall, I was quite happy with how the talk went, and it seems to go down quite well.  There was a fair bit of interaction with the audience, with several questions, which I hope that I was able to answer.  If there are any follow-up questions, then please feel free to get in touch, and I will do my best to respond.</p>

<h1>slides and code</h1>

<p>If you are interested in seeing the slides from the talk, you can find them displayed below, and also available for download <a href="/assets/posts/2013-12-02-slides-code-continuous-integration-101-talk-dunddd/Continuous%20Integration%20101.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Full day developer session in Scotland</h1>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I am able to tell you that, with the help of Scottish Developers, Microsoft Evangelists <a href="http://mtaulty.com/communityserver/blogs/mike_taultys_blog/default.aspx">Mike Taulty</a> and <a href="http://andywigley.com/">Andy Wigley</a>, are going to be doing a full day of sessions in Edinburgh on Saturday 1st June 2013.  It is expected that the day will run from 10am - 4pm, consisting of four different topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Windows 8</strong> - The Developer Overview</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Windows Phone 8</strong> - The Developer Overview</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Azure Mobile Services</strong> - Quick, Easy, and Powerful Mobile Backends</p></li>
<li><p>Architecting &amp; Building Shared Code for Windows and Windows Phone</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Currently, full details of the sessions, and what is going to be contained within them, is still being prepared, but if the session names are anything to go by, this is going to be a great day!  Registration for the day is open, and spaces are limited, so I would encourage you all to get registered as soon as possible.  You can find the registration page <a href="http://mikeandandy2013-eorg.eventbrite.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I won&rsquo;t be able to make it as I will be moving into our new house the day before, but I look forward to hearing all about it!</p>

<h1>Sponsors</h1>
