<h1 id="my-adventures-in-updating-my-chocolatey-pull-request">My adventures in updating my Chocolatey Pull Request</h1>
<p>About 3 months ago, I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/pull/238">pull request</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey">Chocolatey Project</a>.  This was a reasonably simple addition, which added a helper method within Chocolatey which allowed the creation of a generic shortcut anywhere that the user required.  As time passed, other commits were made into the Chocolatey Master branch, and my pull-request had become &quot;dated&quot;.  In addition, in hindsight, I had created 6 commits, for something that could have really been done as a single commit.</p>
<p>Last week, Chocolatey contributor Rich Siegel (<a href="https://twitter.com/rismoney">&#64;rismoney</a>), suggested that I should rebase my pull-request against the latest in the master branch, and also to &quot;tidy&quot; up the multiple commits into a single commit.  The reason to do this was really two-fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>rebasing against the master branch would mean that merging would be simpler</li>
<li>making it one commit would mean that the commit history would be cleaner, and if any bugs were introduced as a result of the pull-request(s) it would be easier to find this in the history</li>
</ul>
<p>My immediate response was, &quot;I would love to do this, but how the hell do I do that?!?&quot;.  Thankfully, Rich was able to spell it out in terms that even I was able to understand!  So that I can refer back to this in the future, I decided to capture the details in this blog post.</p>
<h1 id="where-we-were">Where we were...</h1>
<p>This was the situation that I was in:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had taken a fork of the Chocolatey code into a new repo</li>
<li>I had created a branch called Issue-235 which is where my commits had been added</li>
<li>By branch was behind chocolatey/master by a few commits</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="where-we-wanted-to-get-to">Where we wanted to get to...</h1>
<p>Where we were trying to get to was:</p>
<ul>
<li>My branch brought up to the latest code that was in master</li>
<li>Rewrite commit history by reducing all commits (I had 6) into just one</li>
<li>Update single commit comment to include all details</li>
<li>Update pull request</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-was-required">What was required</h1>
<p>The following gist contains all the commands that were executed:</p>
<p>The final part of what was desired, i.e. updating the pull-request with the changes, haven't <em>automagically</em>.  Thinking about it, this makes sense.  Your pull request is &quot;linked&quot; to the commits in your forked branch.  When this changes, the pull request is also updated.</p>
<p>I have to say a big thanks to Rich for all his help on this.  I learnt a lot by doing this!</p>
<h1 id="should-contributors-keep-their-pull-requests-up-to-date">Should Contributors keep their pull requests up to date?</h1>
<p>Within the discussion of this pull-request, Chocolatey creator Rob Reynolds (<a href="https://twitter.com/ferventcoder">&#64;ferventcoder</a>) suggested that it wasn't the responsibility of the creator of the pull request to keep it &quot;up-to-date&quot;, but rather for the project coordinators to either accept or reject the pull request quickly enough that keeping it up-to-date would not be required.  Personally, I think that this would be the &quot;ideal&quot;, but that we don't live in an ideal world.  Time constraints always mean that things don't happen as quickly as we would like, and as a result, we, as the community, should do what we can to help out.</p>
