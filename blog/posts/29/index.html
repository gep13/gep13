	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I was invited to go hiking today with Nick from the office.</p>

<p>Had a really great time! I thought we had some hiking trails back home in Scotland, but looks like they have got a few more over here!!</p>

<p>Got picked up at 10am, quick stop at Safeway to grab some food, and then it was off to <a href="http://maps.google.ca/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;q=Kananaskis,+AB,+Canada&amp;amp;z=7&amp;amp;iwloc=addr">Kananaskis</a>.  Parked up the car, and then started hiking up a trail that Nick had spotted the last time he went hiking. Not going to lie, it was tough going, and it was quite a hot day, still not used to the temperatures over here, but we made it to the top (when I say the top, I mean the peak that we felt happy with stopping at, a couple who were hiking in front of us went a lot further, but we didn&rsquo;t think it was a good idea to follow them, they were hard-core hikers!!). We made our way back down, and then headed into Kananaskis Village, where we were going to visit Troll Falls. This turned out to be well worth it!! Basically, after a short walk through some forest, you got to a reasonably sized waterfall, where you were able to walk right up to it!! Needless to say, I took lots of photos of it, as well as some videos. If you want to look at the pictures you can see them below, if you want to see the videos, then drop me a line, and I can send them to you.</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>I went to see two films today&hellip;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0949731/">The Happening</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800080/">The Incredible Hulk</a></p>

<p>Have to say that I didn&rsquo;t really enjoy The Happening. I can see what they were trying to do with the film, but just don&rsquo;t think that it came off very well. It was worth a watch, but not great!!</p>

<p>Really enjoyed The Incredible Hulk. The way the film ended it seems like there is going to be another one made, so will have to wait and see on that one.</p>

<p>Saw a couple of trailers for some upcoming films that I really want to go and see, namely:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/08/4808/summary.php">The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor</a>, I am a big fan of this series, so really looking forward to it!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/65/2065/summary.php">The X-Files: I want to believe</a>, again, big fan of all things X-Files, so hopefully this film along with Billy Connolly can live up to the name!!</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>As part of the Global Petroleum Show which is going on in Calgary this week, there was a Professional Bull Riding event at the Saddledome last night. I went along with another guy from the office, and had a great time!!!!</p>

<p>To say that these guys are nuts would be a little bit of an understatement in my opinion!!! And as for the Bull Fighters (the guys who distract the Bull once the Bull Rider falls off so that the Bull doesn&rsquo;t go for him, those guys at just not right in the head!!!) You can see some of the photos that I took while at the show here:</p>

<p>[nggallery id=6]</p>

<p>Some of them aren&rsquo;t very good because I was told that I wasn&rsquo;t allowed to use my camera, so i just used the camera on my phone, but then I saw other people using cameras that were better than mine, so I took mine out my bag and took a few shots. Hope you like them!!</p>

<p>The commentator told us that one of the Bulls that was used in the final round, which was called The Microsoft Challenge Round (wonder how much Microsoft had to pay for that privilege?!?), was over 1 tonne in weight!!! Needless to say, it threw the rider off pretty quickly, and the rider was eliminated from the contest. In the final round, out of the eight riders, there was only one guy who was able to stay on the Bull for the required 8 seconds.</p>

<p>I have got some videos that I took on the night as well, if anyone is interesting in seeing them, leave me a comment, or get in touch direct, and I can send them onto you (have quite got videos working on my site yet, I will at some point though :-))</p>

<p>[singlepic id=326 w=320 h=240 float=]</p>

<p>&hellip;I did!! When I was at the Cinema last weekend to see the new Indiana Jones Movie, I saw the &ldquo;A Taste of Britain&rdquo; store. It was closed, but through the window I could see some Irn Bru. I went back there this Friday just past after work and I bought some.  It was £1.60 for a bottle, but it was well worth it!!!</p>

		<p>Today I visited the Calgary Zoo. Really enjoyed myself there!! Must have spent about 5 hours just wandering round the place trying to see all the animals.</p>

<p>Was really impressed with how easy it was to get to the Zoo. Jumped on the C Train at 7th Street, and a couple stops later I was at the Zoo Station, and then a short walk took me into the Zoo itself. Really very easy. Don&rsquo;t think it would be that easy to get to the Zoo&rsquo;s back home! You can see some of the photos that I took at the Zoo below. Be warned though, there are quite a few of them!!!</p>

		<p>I went to see the new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367882/">Indiana Jones</a> film today, and although I have heard some people say that they didn&rsquo;t enjoy it because it was too far fetched, I have to say that I did enjoy it!!</p>

<p>Granted, the massive alien space at the end was maybe a little bit over the top, but then again, the same could be said about finding the Ark of the Covenant, or the Cup of Christ.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you don&rsquo;t mind a bit of a far fetched story line, I would go and see it. Harrison Ford, although looking a bit old, does a good job!!</p>
